
State-by-State Voting Information: 2018
 
The 2018 General Election is Tuesday, November 6; there are other elections within many states. The table below contains state-specific information in an alphabetical list. (see table below). 
 
Register to vote by contacting your Secretary of State/Board of Elections either by phone to request that a registration form be mailed to you, or online - where you can print a form to mail in. Some states allow online registration (no mailed forms required). Registration deadlines vary by state.
 
If you intend to vote by mail - with a mail-in or absentee ballot - in many states you must submit your mail-in/absentee/vote-by-mail registration form as early as 45 days prior to the election. Mail-in ballots must be postmarked at least one day prior and/or received by Election Day; find state-specific requirements through the table below.
 
If you intend to vote in person -voter identification laws vary by state (see table below). At the polls, you can request a reasonable accommodation or assistance to vote: 
*         Accessible Voting Units (AVUs): Available at voting centers 18 days prior to the election date. Every county must have at least one AVU at each voting center. AVUs must be wheelchair-accessible and screened from other voters to maintain privacy.
An AVU presents your ballot on a monitor. You select choices by touching the screen, using a select wheel, or by using a tool. You can use headphones to listen to the text and prompts on your ballot. Most machines can also be fitted with sip-and-puff tools.
 
*         Assistance voting your ballot: Anyone may assist you in voting your ballot, except your employer or union representative. At a voting center, you may ask for two election workers - one from each political party - to help you fill out your ballot.
A person who has a guardian may still be able to vote and should not be turned away from a voting center by an election worker. Guardianship papers indicate if an individual has the right to vote.
 
If you need to report a problem - please contact Election Protection at 1-866-OUR-VOTE or help@866ourvote.org. Election Protection is a nonpartisan coalition that was formed to ensure that all voters have equal opportunity to participate in the political process.
