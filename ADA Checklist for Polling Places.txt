Evaluating the Physical Accessibility of Polling Places
When choosing a new site for a polling place, elections officials should select a facility that is accessible to voters who use wheelchairs or scooters or who have difficulty walking. Planning for an upcoming election also gives elections officials the opportunity to improve existing polling places that are not accessible by using temporary elements, such as portable ramps, on election day or by working with building owners to make permanent alterations that improve the accessibility of the polling place.
The following checklist is designed to help voting officials determine whether a polling place has basic accessible features needed by most voters with disabilities.  It may be used when evaluating the accessibility of potential new polling places and when identifying physical barriers in existing polling places before temporary or permanent modifications are made to improve accessibility for elections.
Individuals completing the checklist do not necessarily need to be experienced in evaluating buildings and facilities for accessibility.  The checklist is designed to prompt the user to check key features by asking questions about sizes, sloped surfaces, and availability of accessible features, and in some areas it suggests alternatives if a physical barrier is identified. By following the directions provided for filling out the checklist, voting staff and volunteers can identify accessible polling places and develop information used for implementing temporary and permanent modifications.
A voter enters an accessible polling place.

Getting Started
An evaluation of polling place accessibility should focus on those areas of a facility that are important to voting.  These often include parking for voters, a drop off or loading area, the entrance to the polling place, and the pedestrian routes (both exterior and interior) that voters use to get to the voter check-in and voting area.
Before a polling place is evaluated, it is useful for staff or volunteers to review the instructions for using the checklist and become familiar with the questions.  It is also helpful to practice taking measurements and recording information before beginning the evaluation.
When staff arrive at a polling place, it is best to first determine the location of parking, including accessible parking (if any is provided), the entrance that will be used on election day, and the location of the voting area.  If the survey is being done to determine the accessibility of a new location for a polling place, then the walk-through should look for areas that provide the best accessibility, where simple modifications may provide accessibility, or where it may be easiest to improve accessibility by adding temporary features.
Using the Polling Place Checklist
Tools and Documentation
A few simple tools may be used to measure the sizes and the slope of specific elements and spaces:
•         A metal tape measure at least 15-feet long
•         A level with a bubble measure or a digital measure at least twenty-four inches long for measuring slope, and
•         A clipboard, copy of the checklist (one copy per polling place), and pens or pencils.
It is also a good idea to have a film or digital camera to document important areas that may need to be reviewed later. Any camera may be used to shoot photographs but one with a flash is most useful, particularly when indoor photos are needed.
Use the Checklist to Record Data
The checklist is designed to prompt the users on what to look at and where to measure.  All answers and notes should be recorded on the checklist for use later in the planning process. When completed, the checklist should provide an indication of the level of accessibility at the polling place.  If photographs are taken during the survey, it is helpful to note on the checklist that a photo was taken for later review of particular elements, spaces, or conditions.
Completing Measurements and Recording Information One person can complete a survey of a polling place but it is often quicker and easier for two people to work together.  One can be responsible for taking the measurements and the other for recording the information and taking any photographs.
Taking Measurements
Sloped Surfaces
One way to measure slope is to use a 24-inch level with leveling bubble and a tape measure.  Place the level on the incline in the direction you wish to measure.  Rest one end of the level at the highest point of the sloped surface and lift the other end (as shown in the illustration) until the bubble is in the middle of the tube.  This is the "level" position.  While the level is in this position, measure the distance between the end of the level and the sloped surface below.  If the distance is 2 inches or less, then the slope is 1:12 or less.  When the distance is greater than 2 inches, record the distance on the checklist so the exact slope may be calculated later if needed.
Slopes may also be measured using a digital level.  The digital display replaces the bubble and typically gives a reading that may be shown as a digital bubble, degrees, or a percent. Before using a digital level make sure to familiarize yourself with the directions.  Many digital levels need to be calibrated each time they are used.  If you can set the digital display to percent or degrees, the maximum slope generally allowed is 8.33% or 4.76 degrees (for a 1:12 slope).

Measuring slope using a 24-inch level and tape measure
Using the Tape Measure When measuring the width of a parking space or access aisle, the width of an accessible route or the height of an object above the floor, for example, try to keep the tape from sagging or bending.  If the tape is not straight, try to support the tape in
the middle or pull it
tight and take the Using a tape measure to measure the width of a parking space measurement again.
Measuring Door Openings Measuring the clear opening of an accessible door requires special care.  To measure the opening of a standard hinged door, open the door to 90 degrees.  Place the end of the tape measure on the side of the door frame next to the clear opening (as shown in the drawing).  Stretch the tape across the door opening to the face of the door.  This measurement equals the clear open width of
the door, which is typically less than the width of the door.Measuring the clear opening from the face of the doorstop on the frame to the face of the open doorCompleting the Checklist
For each checklist item, check either "yes" or "no."  If the measurement or number falls short of that required for accessibility, write the measurement or number to the right of the question in the area under "Comments."  Add notes or comments as needed.  For some questions when "no" is the answer, the checklist will include a prompt to check for an alternate solution.  Information on alternate access can be used later as voting officials decide how to provide accessible voting.
When completing the survey, it is important to try to answer every question in each section, unless, of course, the element is not present at the particular site under review.  For example, if there is no parking provided on-site at the polling place, or only on-street parking is provided, there is no need to try to measure the size of the parking spaces or to count the number of parking spaces.
The checklist is based on requirements from the ADA Standards for Accessible Design (Standards).  Each item includes a reference to the technical requirements in the Standards from 28 C.F.R. Part 36, Appendix A.  This reference is provided to assist users in looking up the requirement or related requirements when necessary.  An electronic copy of the Standards is available on the ADA Website at www.ada.gov. Printed copies are also available from the ADA Information Line at 800-514-0301 (voice) or 800-514-0383 (TTY).
After Completing the Survey
Completed polling place surveys will provide the information needed to determine which sites are accessible and which may become accessible with permanent or temporary modifications. Checklists where most answers are "yes" will usually indicate an accessible polling place.  Others, where some answers are "no," may become accessible if permanent or temporary modifications are done to remove barriers.  Polling places in older buildings may have few accessible features but some of these voting facilities may be able to be made accessible with temporary modifications, such as portable ramps at the entrance and accessible parking spaces marked off by traffic cones.  There may also be some sites that cannot be made accessible so plans will be needed to offer accessible voting in some other way.
For more information about temporary modifications, see Temporary Solutions for Election Day at the end of each section of this document.
Alterations
When State and local governments make permanent modifications or alterations to facilities that serve as polling places these alterations must comply with the ADA Standards.

Getting to the Polling Place
A.  Parking
Typical Issues
When parking is provided for voters, staff and volunteers, accessible parking must be provided for people with disabilities.  Voters with disabilities who arrive by car need a parking space close to an accessible entrance.  The accessible parking space has an adjacent access aisle that provides needed room for a person to open the car door fully and then stand with the aid of a walker, to transfer to a wheelchair, or to lower a wheelchair lift.  The access aisle connects directly to an accessible route that leads to an accessible building entrance. In order to be usable, the access aisle must be relatively level, clear of gravel or mud, and the surface must be in good condition without wide cracks or broken pavement.

Van-accessible parking spaces serve both cars and vans.
A wide access aisle is needed so a wheelchair lift may be lowered from the van onto the level surface.
An accessible route connects the access aisle of each accessible parking space with the accessible entrance to the polling place. When an accessible route crosses a curb, a curb ramp must be provided.  If the accessible route connects the access aisle to the accessible entrance using the parking lot surface, a marked crosswalk should be provided on the vehicular route.


 Comments 
A1.  If parking is available, count the total number of parking spaces provided for the       Yes polling place.  Are the minimum number of accessible parking spaces provided, based on the total number of available parking spaces (see table below)?

Temporary Solutions for Election Day
Parking
Problem One:
Parking is available, but no accessible parking is provided or there are not enough accessible parking or van-accessible spaces.
Suggestion:  Find a relatively level parking area near the accessible entrance and then designate the area for accessible parking spaces and adjacent access aisles. Use three parking spaces to make two accessible parking spaces with an access aisle.  Traffic cones or other temporary elements may be used to mark the spaces and access aisles.  Provide a sign designating each accessible parking space and make sure the access aisle of each space is connected to the accessible route to the accessible entrance.
Problem Two:
Accessible parking is provided, but it does not have a marked access aisle next to each accessible space.
Suggestion:  Restripe the accessible parking spaces to provide an access aisle.  As a temporary solution for election day, use traffic cones to mark off the access aisle and curb ramp area.  The first accessible parking space provided should be a vanaccessible parking space with an access aisle that is at least 96 inches wide.
Problem Three:
Accessible parking spaces or access aisles are on a sloped surface.
Suggestion:  Find a parking area that is close to the accessible entrance and more level.  Provide accessible parking spaces and access aisles in that area.  Make sure the accessible parking spaces connect to an accessible route to the entrance. Provide a sign designating each accessible parking space.
Problem Four:
No sign with the international symbol of accessibility is installed at each accessible parking space.
Suggestion:  Provide a temporary sign in front of each accessible parking space.

Three standard parking spaces are converted into an accessible parking space with an access aisle.  Cones mark the access aisle and a temporary curb ramp with edge protection connects to an accessible route to the polling place.

B.  Passenger Drop-Off Areas
Typical Issues
Some voters with disabilities will be driven to the polling place and dropped off near an entrance in a passenger drop-off area.  If the polling place is served by passenger drop-off areas, then at least one drop-off area must be accessible.  An accessible drop-off area, also known as an accessible passenger loading zone, must have a level access aisle, adjacent and parallel to the vehicle space.  Where a curb separates the vehicle space from the access aisle or the access aisle from an accessible route, a curb ramp must be provided so people with disabilities can get to the accessible route leading to the accessible entrance.

Passenger Drop-Off Areas
Passenger Drop-Off Areas Checklist
If a passenger loading area is provided, you should answer the following questions.
B1.  Is a relatively level (1:50 or 2% maximum      Yes         No slope in all directions) access aisle provided adjacent and parallel to the side of the vehicle pull-up area? [ADA Stds 4.6.6]
If No, look for another relatively level location that is on an accessible route.
 Comments 
B3.  Is the area for the access aisle at least 5-feet wide and 20-feet long? [ADA Stds 4.6.6]
Note:  Unlike an accessible parking space, the surface for the access aisle does not have to be marked or striped.
B4.  Is the vertical height for the vehicle route to the loading zone, the drop off area, and the exit at least 114 inches (9 feet 6 inches) in height? [ADA Stds 4.6.5]
B5.  Is a curb ramp provided between the vehicle pull up area and the access aisle (see figure above) or the access aisle and the accessible route (see figure on page 9) to the accessible entrance? [ADA Stds 4.6.6]
If No, is there another area with a curb ramp connected to an accessible route that could serve as the drop-off area?Yes
Yes
YesNo
No
NoB2.  Is the vehicle space relatively level (2%          Yes         No maximum slope in all directions)?
B6.  If a curb ramp is provided, is the slope of the ramp   Yes         No surface (not counting the side flares) no more than 1:12?
[ADA Stds 4.7.2]
                                                                       B7.  Is the width of the curb ramp surface at least 36 inches?                 Yes               No
[ADA Stds 4.7.3]
B8.  Does an accessible route connect the curb ramp to the          Yes         No accessible entrance? [ADA Stds 4.1.2(1)]
Passenger Drop-Off Areas
Temporary Solutions for Election Day
Passenger Drop-Off Areas
Problem:
A passenger drop-off and loading zone is provided but there is no curb ramp between the vehicle area and the sidewalk leading to the accessible polling place entrance.
Suggestion:  Provide a portable ramp with edge protection in an area where the vehicle area and the sidewalk are relatively level.  The curb ramp must connect to an accessible route to the accessible polling place entrance.
If the drop-off and loading zone is not relatively level, consider relocating the accessible drop-off area and using one parking space next to the area where accessible parking is located to provide an accessible drop-off and loading zone.  Cones or another temporary barrier may be needed to keep the parking space clear.

A portable ramp with edge protection is used to provide an accessible route from the drop-off and loading area to the accessible polling place entrance.
C.  Sidewalks and Walkways
Part 1.  Typical Issues for Voters Who Use Wheelchairs, Scooters or Other Mobility Aids
There must be at least one exterior accessible route that connects accessible passenger drop-off areas, accessible parking spaces, and other accessible elements, for example a route from a bus stop to an accessible building entrance.  The accessible route is essential for people who have difficulty walking or who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids to get to the accessible entrance of the polling place.
An accessible route is at least 36 inches wide and may narrow briefly to 32 inches wide where utility poles, post-mounted signs, furniture, and doorways are located along an accessible route.  Abrupt level changes, steps, or steeply sloped sidewalks cannot be part of an accessible route.  Where ramps are used, they cannot be steeper than 1:12.  Ramps with a vertical rise of more than 6 inches must have handrails on both sides.  Ramps must also have edge protection to stop wheelchairs from falling off the sides, and level landings at the top and bottom of each segment and where a ramp changes direction.

Sidewalks and Walkways - Voters with Mobility Disabilities
Problem One:
The sidewalk connecting parking to the polling place entrance is too steep to be accessible. Suggestion:  Check to see if there is another sidewalk that provides an accessible route to the accessible entrance.  Sometimes there is a less direct route that can serve as the accessible route.
Problem Two:
The accessible route crosses a curb and no curb ramp is provided.
Suggestion:  Install a portable ramp with edge protection.
Problem Three:
One or two steps are part of the walkway leading to the accessible entrance. Suggestion:  Install a portable ramp no steeper than 1:12 slope with edge protection and handrails.

C.  Sidewalks and Walkways
Part 2.  Typical Issues for Voters Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision Objects that are wall-mounted, that project into a pedestrian route from the side, or that are overhead must be located so that people who are blind or who have low vision will either detect the objects before they run into them or safely pass under them.  Examples include handrail extensions on stairs and ramps, post or wall-mounted signs, outdoor drinking fountains, and tree limbs that are lower than 80 inches above the walk.  Pedestrian routes open to voters, such as sidewalks, courtyards, and plazas, must be free of overhanging objects that are less than 80 inches above the route.  Objects more than 27 inches and less than 80 inches above the route that protrude from the side more than 4 inches are also a hazard.  Because people can walk on any sidewalk, not just the accessible routes, all exterior pedestrian routes serving or leading to the voting area must be checked.  The following checklist applies to sidewalks and walkways leading to the polling place and voting area.
Notes:
 The bottom of the handrail extensions turn down so a person who is blind or has low vision can detect the hazard before running into it.
 Signs or other objects in the pedestrian route can be a hazard if the bottom is more than 27 inches but less than 80 inches above the route.
 Objects that overhang the pedestrian route must be at least 80 inches above the route.

[ADA Stds 4.4, 4.2.1(3), 4.1.3(2)]
If No, can the object be lowered, removed, or modified or can the route be changed to avoid the object?
This wall-mounted box is mounted too high to be detectable by a person who is blind.
 Comments Placing an object, like this sign, under the box provides a way to warn the person before they walk into the side of the box.
                                                                                                             C2-2.  Are the undersides of exterior                           Yes               No
stairs enclosed or protected with a canedetectable barrier so that people who are blind or have low vision will not hit their heads on the underside?
[ADA Stds 4.4.2]
If No, can a barrier or enclosure be added below the stair or can the route be relocated away from the stair?
    When the underside of a stair is open, it is a hazard to people who are blind or have low vision.  Enclosing the area
below the stair or installing a cane-detectable barrier helps the person to stop before hitting her head.
Sidewalks and Walkways - Part 2
C2-3.  Are all objects that hang over the pedestrian          Yes         No routes 80 inches or more above the route?
If No,  can the objects be removed or relocated, or can a detectable object be added below?
Temporary Solutions for Election Day
Sidewalks and Walkway Hazards
 Comments Problem One:  Branches or other objects over a walkway or pedestrian route are lower than 80 inches above the walk.
Suggestion:  Prune the branches or remove the items that are hanging below 80 inches.
Another approach is to install a detectable barrier under the item that is too low.  The detectable barrier or object must be within the detectable range of 27 inches or less above the route.
Problem Two:  One or more objects protrude too far from the side into the circulation path causing a hazard for people who are blind or who have low vision.
Suggestion:  When people who are blind or who have low vision use a cane to detect hazards, objects located at 27 inches or lower are detectable.  When an object is located more than 27 inches off the ground it is a hazard if the object protrudes more than 4 inches into the circulation path.  To make a protruding object detectable:
Place an object or a barrier below the protruding object in the cane-detectable area not more than 27 inches above the floor.
If the protruding object can be moved, lower the object so its bottom is within the canedetectable area (not more than 27 inches above the floor).
Prune or alter the protruding object so it does not protrude over the path.

Entering the Polling Place
D.  Building Entrance
Typical Issues
An accessible polling place must have at least one accessible entrance.  The accessible entrance must be connected to an accessible route.  An accessible entrance must provide at least one accessible door with maneuvering space, accessible door hardware, and enough clear width to allow people who use crutches, a cane, walker, scooter or wheelchair to use it.
Accessible route connecting accessible parking and drop-off area (if provided) to the accessible entrance.
If the accessible entrance is not the main entrance to the polling place, then signs must be located at inaccessible entrances to the polling place to direct voters to the accessible entrance.  The accessible entrance must remain open when the polling place is open.

Examples of signs for inaccessible polling place entrances directing a voter to the accessible entrance.

 Comments 
D1.  Is there at least one accessible entrance connected to an accessible route?
[ADA Stds 4.1.3(1)]
Notes:  If this entrance is not the main entrance, it needs to be kept unlocked during voting hours.
If there are inaccessible entrances serving the polling place, signs will be needed at inaccessible entrance(s) to direct voters to the nearest accessible entrance.
D2.  Does at least one door or one side of a double leaf door at the accessible entrance provide at least 32 inches clear passage width when the door is open 90 degrees?
[See figure 24 in the appendix at the back of the checklist]
If No, does another entrance have an accessible door or can both doors be propped open during voting?  Other possible solutions are to enlarge the door opening, use a swing clear hinge, or, if a double leaf door, use uneven width doors.

Temporary Solutions for Election Day
Accessible Entrance to Polling Place
Problem One:
One or two steps at the entrance prevent access.
Suggestion:  If another entrance is accessible and on an accessible route from accessible parking, designate it as the accessible entrance and install a directional sign at the main entrance directing voters to the accessible entrance.  Keep the accessible entrance unlocked during voting hours.
If another accessible entrance is not available, install a temporary ramp with edge protection and handrails.
Problem Two:
There is a small step at the entrance.
 Comments Suggestion:  Install a short temporary ramp to provide a smooth transition.
Problem Three:
Entrance door threshold has an abrupt change in level of more than 1/4 inch and no beveled sides.
Suggestion:  If the threshold is not more than 3/4 inches high, add beveled surfaces to both sides of the threshold or replace with a new threshold that is no more than 1/2 inch high and that has beveled sides.
Problem Four:
Entrance door to the building is heavy and difficult to open.
Suggestion:  Keep the door propped open or station volunteers near the door to open it for voters.
Problem Five:
Door handle and/or latch at the entry door is not accessible.
Suggestion:  These are three typical solutions:  add an accessible pull or handle to the outside of the door and leave the door unlatched, or install an accessible door handle and hardware, or leave the door propped in an open position.

E.  Hallways and Corridors
Part 1.  Typical Issues for Voters Who Use Wheelchairs, Scooters, or Other Mobility Devices
The interior accessible route connects the accessible entrance with the voting area.  Typically made up of hallways, corridors, and interior rooms and spaces, the accessible route is essential for people who have difficulty walking or who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids to get to the voting area.
An accessible route is at least 36 inches wide and may narrow briefly to 32 inches wide where the route passes through doors or next to furniture and building elements.  High thresholds, abrupt level changes, steps, or steeply sloped hallways cannot be part of an accessible route.  Where ramps are used, they cannot be steeper than 1:12.  Ramps with a vertical rise of more than 6 inches must have handrails on both sides.  Ramps must also have edge protection to stop wheelchairs from falling off the sides, and level landings at the top and bottom of each segment and where a ramp changes direction.

Temporary Solutions for Election Day
Interior Hallways and Corridors to Voting Area
Problem 1:
One or more steps along hallway to voting area block access.
Suggestion:  Install a portable ramp with edge protection and handrails as shown in the figure or relocate the accessible voting to another area that is on an accessible route.
A portable ramp with edge protection and handrails is placed over stairs to provide an accessible route on Election Day.
Problem 2:
Voting area is not on an accessible route and cannot be made accessible. Suggestion:  Look for another area where accessible voting may be provided.  For example, if the living room of a private home used for voting is up several steps, perhaps the garage may be accessible when entered from the driveway.  Or, if a church's basement is used as a polling place and it is not accessible, perhaps one of the ground floor rooms could be used as the accessible voting area.
E.  Hallways and Corridors
Part 2.  Typical Issues for Voters Who are Blind or Who Have Low Vision People who are blind or have low vision may walk along any route to access the voting area, not just the accessible routes. That means pedestrian routes open to voters serving or leading to the voting area, such as hallways, corridors and the voting space, must be free of objects that cannot be detected by a person who is blind or visually impaired.  Objects that are wall-mounted, that project into a pedestrian route from the side, or that are overhead must be located so that voters who are blind or who have a visual impairment will either detect the objects before they run into them or safely pass under them. These routes must be free of overhanging objects that are less than 80 inches above the floor and side objects that protrude into the route more than 4 inches when the bottom of the object is more than 27 inches above the floor.  Items to watch for include wall-mounted fire extinguishers and wall-mounted display cases when the bottom is more than 27 inches above the floor, wall sconces and light fixtures that protrude more than 4 inches off the wall, and open staircases, exit signs, overhead signs, banners, and arched doorways that are lower than 80 inches above the floor.
The following checklist applies to pedestrian routes serving or leading to the voting area.
Notes:
 Wall-mounted drinking fountains are a hazard when the front projects more than 4 inches beyond the wall and the bottom is more than 27 inches above the floor.
 Wall-mounted objects cannot project more than 4 inches beyond the wall if the bottom is not in the cane-detectable area below 27 inches off the floor.

Problem One:
Wall-mounted display case is a protruding object hazard because it is more than 4 inches from the wall and the bottom of the case is more than 27 inches above the floor.
Suggestion:  Place a detectable object or skirting below the case.  The bottom of the skirting or detectable object must be no higher than 27 inches above the floor.
Problem Two:
Ceiling or wall-mounted television monitor has less than 80 inches of clearance between the floor and the bottom of the unit.
Suggestion:  Place a detectable object below the unit (no more than 27 inches above the floor) so a voter who is blind will not walk into the television.
Problem Three:
The bottom of a stair is open and voters who are blind or who have low vision can hit their heads on the underside of the stair.
Suggestion:  Provide a detectable fence or other object so voters cannot walk under the stair.
A detectable fence placed under this stair keeps people from running into the bottom of the open stair.
