Today, more than 35 million Americans with disabilities are eligible to vote in
the United States, accounting for roughly one-sixth of the total electorate.
This ever-growing population of voters also faces educational, cultural and
political barriers that can make participating in elections difficult. Since
our establishment, the EAC has worked to expand access, regardless of a voter’s
abilities, by providing resources, promoting best practices, educating voters
with disabilities about their </p>

McCormick conducted a town hall discussion with voters with disabilities and

(NDRN) conference. During this event, participants shared their voting

shared this valuable feedback with election officials and continued their
communication with voters with disabilities through the 2018 midterm election. </p>

The EAC also ensures voters are educated about their rights. The EAC has
distributed more than 20,000 federal voting rights cards in Braille, large
print and plain language to voters with disabilities, advocacy organizations,
and election officials across the United States since 2016. EAC Commissioners
stress the need to find election solutions that will both increase security and
expand access in Congressional testimony, meetings with state and local
election officials, public appearances and public articles. The EAC also
promotes best practices throughout the year with voter outreach, updated
materials and online campaigns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.1pt;margin-bottom:15.9pt;
margin-left:-.3pt'>While jurisdictions have made advances in providing access
to voters with disabilities since the passage of HAVA, more work needs to be
done to meet the promise of private and independent voting for all. Moving
forward, election officials should be continuously reminded to do all they can
to ensure accessibility at every point in the voting process. </p>

serve as exemplary models for election officials. In 2018, several of these
features focused on how to better assist voters with access needs. Contra Costa
County, California, for example, provided specialized training to its election
workers, placing them in the shoes of voters who need assistance to give them a
new perspective and providing real-life examples of situations that can occur
at a polling place on Election Day. Other jurisdictions, such as El Paso
County, Colorado, have partnered with disability rights groups and resource
centers to create universally accessible polling places. By seeking out
partners and building relationships within the community, election officials
can benefit from additional expertise and make the most of their often-limited
resources.</span></p>
