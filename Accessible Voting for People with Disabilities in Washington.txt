Accessibility concerns
If you or someone you know is concerned about a voting center's accessibility,  please contact the Secretary of State's Elections Division at (800) 448-4881. 
Voting Centers
Federal and state laws require elections officials to provide voting equipment that allows voters with disabilities to vote as privately and independently as possible. 
Voting centers must meet all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. In addition, each county has at least one Accessible Voting Unit (AVU) at each voting center. For more information visit vote.wa.gov
Accessible Voting Units (AVUs)
AVUs are available 18 days before Election Day until 8 p.m. on Election Day. AVUs must be wheelchair-accessible and screened from other voters to maintain privacy. 
Selections are made on AVUs by touching the screen, using a select wheel, or by using a tool. You can also use headphones and listen to your ballot. Machines can be fitted with sip-and-puff tools.  
The AVU makes it possible for you to make and change your vote before casting your ballot. You will be alerted if you have made too many selections (overvote). In the case of visually impaired voters, an audio warning is provided. AVUs provide a paper record that can be used in the case of an audit or hand recount.
Assistance voting your ballot
Anyone may assist you in voting your ballot, except your employer or union representative. At a voting center, you may ask for two election workers to help you fill out your ballot. 
A person who has a guardian may still be able to vote and should not be turned  away from a voting center by an election worker. Guardianship papers indicate if an individual has the right to vote. If there is ever doubt about a person's voting status, the person should vote a provisional ballot. 
Voters' Pamphlet
Audio and plain text files of the voters' pamphlet are available online at  vote.wa.gov. If you don't have online access, audio files are available on CD  or USB through subscription. To join, please contact the Elections Division at  (800) 448-4881 or email voterspamphlet@sos.wa.gov.
