<h1><a name="_Toc460524434">Current VVSG requirements for assistive technology</a></h1>

</div>

<p class=Body>VVSG 1.1 says that the voting system must not require voters to
bring any special technology to the polling place in most cases. The discussion
says that it does not “eliminate the need for a voter’s ordinary
non-interacting devices, such as eyeglasses or canes.” It also requires that
systems not interfere with the use of common assistive technology (AT) such as
hearing aids or mobility aids, and allows for some types of AT to be connected
using an industry standard jack.</p>

<p class=Body>The full text of the requirements for assistive technology is at

<h1><a name="_Toc460524435">Why guidance for assistive technology might need
updating</a></h1>

</div>

<p class=Body>The requirements in VVSG 1.1 were drafted in 2007 (although the
final version was not adopted until 2015). This work, then, was largely
undertaken before widespread availability of mobile devices, such as
smartphones and tablets<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
which have been part of both a rapid increase in the availability of assistive
technologies and and (in some cases) a sharp decrease in the cost. </p>

<p class=Body>The extraordinary expansion in technology generally, coupled with
the specific availability of mobile devices have both changed the landscape in
several ways:</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>New technologies are available that might be incorporated into
voting systems.</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Voters themselves might routinely use new devices and functional
features both externally, as supporting technologies, and/or with the
expectation that they will be able to use them to interact with some parts of a
voting system.</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Many of these “assistive” technologies are available to any voter
on mainstream consumer devices.</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Personal assistive technologies can fill gaps in the
accessibility features, making voting systems more universal. </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpLast>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body>Understanding which assistive technologies are already in use and
what new ideas are actively being explored has implications beyond accessible
voting for people with disabilities. Researchers often investigate how new
technologies can be used in extreme conditions as a way of pushing the
boundaries of knowledge. Those same technologies first used for people with
disabilities then often make their way into mainstream use. This is the
opposite of much commercial development, which tends to start with the
broadest, easiest use case, and then expand to additional audiences. </p>

<p class=Body>This paper does not include a review of the number of people with
disabilities who might use the technologies discussed here. A related paper, <i>Use
of Personal Assistive Technologies in Voting</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>[2]</span></span></span></a>,
already covers the prevalence of disabilities and the cost of personal
assistive technologies.</p>

<p class=Body>Like other standards, requirements for voting systems need to be
robust to assure they remain useful over many years. Looking at emerging technology
can help us predict which technologies might become so common that they are an
expected part of everyday life, much as the idea that anyone can have a camera,
phone, and GPS in their pocket. </p>

<h1><a name="_Toc460524436">How this white paper is organized</a></h1>

</div>

<p class=Body>One of the challenges of developing this white paper was deciding
how to organize the information. There has not been  consensus on the best
approach. Past work has included information structured by disability,
functionality, and system characteristics. The proposed structure for the
requirements on human factors and privacy being used by the <a
href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/vote/nist-voting-public-working-groups.cfm"><b>NIST-EAC
Public Working Groups</b></a> is organized by the POUR Principles (perceivable,
operable, understandable, and robust) from the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"><b>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</b></a>
(WCAG 2.0).</p>

<p class=Body>The problem is that almost any structure leads to having
requirements repeated in different sections. </p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>We started this work by thinking about the voter
journey, that is, all the steps a voter takes in voting at a polling place. We
identified the following major steps: </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Finding their way from the polling place from street to entrance</p>

</span></span>Identifying themselves at the registration desk</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Verifying and casting their ballot</p>

<p class=Body>The VVSG is concerned with voting systems, a subset of election
systems and the entire voter experience. However, voters may arrive at a
polling place with assistive technology in hand, and there are interactions
between voting systems and other systems used in the polling place, so we
considered the entire experience from arriving and entering, to leaving. </p>

<p class=Body>Of course, there are wide variations in how these steps are
performed, depending on local election law and customs, and the voting systems
in use. However, from the perspective of a voter, each of these activities is a
hurdle to be negotiated. </p>

<p class=Body>Within each step of the journey, we discuss possible barriers,
who might be affected by the barrier, and technologies that might remove or
reduce the barrier through either personal AT or features built into the
election system. Where a technology might be used in more than one place, we
have included it in the step where it seems most critical. </p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>We have not addressed the physical location—the built
environment—of the polling place. Those issues are well covered elsewhere: </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The ADA and the <a
href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/113-ada-standards/background/adaag/422-a-guide-to-adaag-provisions"><b>ADA
Architectural Guidelines</b></a> (ADAAG) cover the physical space requirements
and reach-and-touch guidelines for equipment. (These requirements are included
in the VVSG in Section 3.3.5: Design for Mobility Aids.)</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The Department of Justice <a
href="https://www.ada.gov/votingck.htm"><b>ADA Checklist for Polling Places</b></a>
includes ways to ensure that the physical path to the polling place, and
navigation within it, meet accessibility guidelines for clearance, ramps, and
obstructions. </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>There are many advocacy and self-advocacy projects focused on the
polling place. The projects by local groups within the <a
href="http://www.ndrn.org/en/public-policy/voting.html"><b>National Disability
Rights Network</b></a> are a good example. They include polling place
accessibility surveys of voters,  checklists to help local election officials
provide more accessible polling places, and a project that engages officials
and advocates to better understand the accessibility issues.</p>

<p class=Body>We did not include important final steps, such as reading results
or checking  voting status online because these activities typically take place
outside of the polling place, where voters’ personal technologies are used in
their own technology setup. These interactions are covered by the ADA and
Section 508 or equivalent state requirements. Since 2010, the Department of
Justice has relied on the public Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG
2.0) in disability rights litigation<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid #595959 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<h1><a name="_Toc460524437">New technologies that might be used at the polling
place</a></h1>

</div>

<p class=Body>The broad goal for the use of technologies (or non-technological
assistive devices or procedures) is to ensure that voters are able to use the
communication and interaction methods that are most familiar to them. </p>

<p class=Body>We looked for emerging technologies that  either are already in
common use, or might be generally available in the next 5-10 years. </p>

<p class=Body>One of the challenges in deciding which new technologies might
become useful in elections is that they often require wide adoption for enough
people to both know how to use them and expect them to be available. QR codes
provide a good example of the challenge. These codes are widely used in Asia as
a way of communicating web links. They could be useful in providing links to
all sorts of election information (and help solve the challenge of long links
that are hard to type). Unfortunately, this use  is not common in the United
States. On the other hand, they are widely used on tickets and boarding passes,
suggesting that they can be helpful as a specialized technology if incorporated
appropriately into elections.</p>

<p class=Body>This is not an exhaustive survey of available technologies,
products, or research projects. Instead, we have attempted to show the range
and type of assistive technology entering the mainstream and how it might be
helpful in elections.</p>

<p class=Body>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc460524438">Finding their way to the polling place from street
to polling place</a></h2>

<p class=Body>The goal of any technology in this stage of the voter journey is
to allow people with disabilities the same degree of independence as any other
voter. If a polling place is staffed with people to provide directions for
everyone, that works for voters with disabilities as well.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524439">Signage</a></h3>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>Signs are a low-tech and important part of wayfinding.
As a reminder:</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>All signs should meet general regulations for typography (font
size, contrast), location, and height to make signs easy to read. Signs should
be placed so that they are easily visible from all directions. </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>All turns or directions from the street to the polling place need
similar signage.  </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Braille is required for door signs, elevators, and other
navigation inside a building.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524440">Smartphone wayfinding apps</a></h3>

<p class=BodyBullets style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Many smartphone
apps and GPS services support general wayfinding that voters can use to find
the polling place. Newer apps include information about features of the
landscape that are helpful to everyone. Wayfinding apps can be used for
real-time navigation or to simulate a location to plan a route in advance.</p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>A wide variety of wayfinding apps offer users many choices
among interaction styles and features. </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>General navigation apps include Apple and Google maps, <a
href="https://www.waze.com/"><b>WAZE</b></a> and other GPS navigation. </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Location-finding apps such as <a href="https://foursquare.com/"><b>FourSquare</b></a>
and <a href="https://www.yelp.com/"><b>Yelp</b></a> also provide links and
directions to places that can include polling places.</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Election websites that offer a way to look up polling places can
also provide addresses in a way that works seamlessly with map and wayfinding
apps.</p>

<p class=Body>There are also apps created as assistive technology such as <a
href="http://blindsquare.com/"><b>Blindsquare</b></a><span class=MsoHyperlink>
from </span>MIPsoft<span class=MsoHyperlink>,</span> <a
href="http://tech.aph.org/ne_info.htm"><b>Nearby Explorer</b></a> from the
American Printing House for the Blind, and the <a
href="https://www.senderogroup.com/products/RNIBGPS/index.html"><b>RNIB
Navigator</b></a> from the Sendero Group. These apps add features for
non-visual use, like periodic announcements about the surrounding location and
progress towards a destination, and the use of headset controls and gestures in
addition to on-screen controls.  They also feature displays to assist those
with low vision, including large text and high contrast options. </p>

<p class=Body>The challenges for these apps is not only having the mapping and
navigation itself, but also having the data about the local area, and having
mapping data down to the granular level needed for non-visual navigation.
Although beyond the scope of the VVSG, the need for this data suggests an
opportunity to make it easier for people who rely on wayfinding apps by making
sure that detailed data about polling places is available.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524441">Wayfinding beacons</a> </h3>

<p class=Body>Although these are not yet commonly deployed, several research
projects explore the use of beacons to indicate particular locations, such as
the door to the polling place building, a specific room, or the voting machine.
These systems work by providing a communication signal that a wayfinding app can
use as a homing beacon, guiding the user to the location. To provide the best
results, a network of beacons is ideal since such a network makes it possible
to receive detailed directions, rather than simply identifying a specific
landmark.</p>

<p class=Body>Early projects have focused on campuses or building complexes
that are not mapped well by the commercial GPS services. Accessibility features
may include announcing landmarks, directions to accessible ramps and elevators,
or warning of obstacles ahead. </p>

<p class=Body>As with other navigation systems, for beacon navigation to become
widespread, a reliable and extensive dataset is required, and standards for
communicating the data through an app or other device must be in place. </p>

<p class=Body>Some examples of these projects and explanations of how beacons
are used include:</p>

<p class=Body>Wearables including the <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/"><b>AppleWatch</b></a>,
personal monitors such as <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/"><b>Fitbit</b></a>, <a
href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/products?gclid=CPXp1dyM6s4CFQRehgodL5EEuw"><b>Polar
SportsWatch</b></a>, and other sports bands and accompanying apps can also
support wayfinding in several ways. They all use the wearable for communication
with the user, relying on a smartphone for GPS, web connections, and other
data. </p>

<p class=Body>The communication is non-visual; for example, the device  might vibrate
or make a sound to indicate locations or help avoid obstacles. </p>

<h3>Wearable video displays</h3>

<p class=Body>Another form of wearable that might be used for both navigation
to and around the polling place, or for interacting with the ballot are video
goggles. The best known of these devices is the now-discontinued <a
href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/"><b>GoogleGlass</b></a>. Although
Glass and other products such as Sony Glasstron failed in the marketplace, a
new generation of gaming headsets are starting to appear on the market. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc460524443">Navigation within the polling place</a></h2>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>Within the building, general navigation tools are less
useful because inside spaces are not as well mapped. There can also be problems
with reception and GPS accuracy indoors. Communication with beacons, using
technologies like Bluetooth, do not rely on satellite or cellular systems.</p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>In addition, the polling place itself is typically set
up for each election, so it would not be included in any general maps of a
space. Even a vote center in a government building might have differences in
the setup from election to election.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524444">Computer and camera-based visual navigation systems</a></h3>

<p class=Body>Some navigation systems use cameras, mounted on glasses or worn
around the user’s neck, to support navigation and relay information about the
immediate environment. Instead of relying on a database of mapping details,
they use image recognition. </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span

<p class=Body-ListIntro>There is also related research into assessing images
and producing accurate alternative text. Although this ability is not directly
related to navigation, it is an example of the kinds of research projects that
are teaching computers to understand what they see through cameras.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524445">Indoor beacons</a> </h3>

<p class=Body>The same sort of beacons discussed previously could be used
within the polling place if they were easy enough to set up and communicated
with popular apps. They also avoid the reception problems of systems that rely
on external communications like GPS.</p>

<p class=Body>Challenges in using  indoor beacons include cost, how easy they
are to set up, and whether users will be familiar with them.</p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>The iRobot Roomba Virtual Wall is an example of a
commercial beacon system that is easy and flexible. These small beacons can be
placed anywhere to guide the automatic vacuum cleaner from room to room or
create a barrier.  Although this system is for a specific product, it’s easy to
imagine how something similar could be used with other navigation apps.</p>

<p class=Body>Additional experiments with indoor location in public places
include:</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc460524446">Identifying themselves at the registration desk</a></h2>

<p class=Body>The polling place registration desk functions include both
allowing the voter to identify themselves and any need to “sign in.” In this
part of the process, there are many communication challenges for people who
have disabilities related to hearing, vision, receptive or expressive language,
and dexterity. The ability to use the communication methods these people
generally use to interact in public is especially important here.  </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524447">Hearing aids</a></h3>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>At their simplest, there are some emerging systems that
provide amplification and background muting, but they have typically raised
questions about whether they are medical devices or personal technology. Their
advantages in the polling place might include not relying on electromagnetic
coils and being less susceptible to interference.  </p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The <a href="http://bioaid.org.uk/"><b>BioAid project</b></a>

apps that use the mobile device’s microphone and conventional earbuds with
audio processing to enhance sound. </p>

<p class=Body>As these tools become more popular, they are likely to appear as
an alternative to conventional hearing aids. Pollworkers might need training to
understand that, although the voter may be wearing earbuds, this does not necessarily
mean they are listening to music.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524448">Speech to text systems</a></h3>

<p class=BodyBullets style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Dictation systems
like the Dragon family of products from Nuance have long been in popular use as
AT to help people type without the use of their hands, but they typically
require training for an individual’s voice. </p>

<p class=Body>New technologies make it easier for computers to understand
speech, and that has led to applications and devices to help voters hear and
understand what is being said to them. These technologies are making use of the
built-in options mobile devices have, sometimes with cloud support for speech
recognition. </p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>The technical challenges for use as a way to support a
conversation are the processing time needed for the conversion and the accuracy
of the results. The latter is getting much better, especially for
conversational speech, but may still have problems interpreting elections “terms
of art.” Some examples of speech-to-text projects include:</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

interface, and claim to work in real time.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524449">Sign language interpretation</a></h3>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>Several research projects are working on being able to
understand sign language and interpret it to speech or vice versa. The Deaf
community has noted strongly that, like automatic captions, the results are not
ready for general use, but these systems will most likely continue to improve.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524450">Text-to-speech systems</a> </h3>

<p class=Body>Voters have to identify themselves to poll workers in order to
sign in. In some jurisdictions, they are required to announce themselves so
poll watchers can hear. This can be a challenge for many voters including those
who cannot speak, who speak with a heavy accent, or who have a fear of speaking
publicly.</p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>There are many types of <a
href="http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC/"><b>Augmentative and
Alternative Communication</b></a> (AAC) tools that are designed for people with
speech disabilities. They use custom interfaces to collect input in the form of
gestures, simple sign language, or symbol selection and convert them to speech.

<h3><a name="_Toc460524451">Identification readers</a></h3>

<p class=Body>Electronic poll books often include the ability to read an ID
card to identify a voter. Although this may be an official ID, such as a
driver’s license or state-issued non-driver ID card, it can also be a bar code
or QR code supplied by the election department. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524452">Signature systems</a></h3>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>Although not a digital technology, a simple signature
guide may be an important AT to help voters sign a poll-book. This also
suggests that building physical or haptic boundaries around the signature area
on a digital screen is also useful. </p>

<p class=BodyBullets style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Some electronic
pollbooks use external signature pads, where the bezel creates a natural
boundary.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524453">Biometric ID systems</a></h3>

<p class=Body>There is a lot of literature about the degradation of the
signature as robust identification in the digital age.</p>

<p class=Body>Some organizations, such as Disney, rely on other biometrics such
as a fingerprint or hand print. Other options include retina scans or vein
patterns. All of them may pose accessibility challenges because not everyone
has the capability to provide this data. One way to address this challenge is
to be sure that voters are offered biometrics as one of several options. These
systems may become widespread in the future.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524454">Portable magnifiers</a></h3>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>People who have low vision use both optical and electronic
magnifiers to read labels and other information. A typical device will work in
real time or capture the image, enlarging the text to the desired
magnification. Many of these devices are large and generally used in a single
location. However, there are also many portable devices, often the size of a
large smartphone, that could be used in a polling place. </p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>Electronic magnifiers are often tailored to specific
disabilities.</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpLast>Portable magnifiers are also used in marking,
verifying, and casting a ballot.</p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc460524456">Receiving a ballot or authorization to vote</a></h2>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>There are many variations for what happens after
someone is authorized to vote and when they are ready to mark a paper or
electronic ballot. A few low-tech and digital tools to help with this process
are mentioned here.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524457">Activation cards with directional indicators</a></h3>

<p class=Body>Activation cards can be manufactured with a notch or corner cut
so that they are asymmetrical, helping voters orient them correctly.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524458">Remembering preferences</a></h3>

<p class=Body>Epollbooks in some states include an indication of whether a
voter has requested assistance in the past.</p>

<p class=Body>Just as the <a href="http://gpii.net/"><b>Global Public Inclusive
Infrastructure</b></a> (GPII) proposes cloud-based storage of personal
preferences, the voter registration database could store a limited number of
settings/preferences, at the voter’s discretion. An activation card or other
means could be used to transfer that information to the voting system.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524459">Transferring voting choices prepared at home</a></h3>

<p class=Body>The <a href="http://vsap.lavote.net/"><b>Los Angeles Voting
Systems Assessment Project</b></a> (VSAP) proposes a unique solution to the
challenge of quickly marking a long ballot by allowing voters to store their
vote preferences in a QR code. Before beginning to mark their ballot, voters
would have the option of scanning that code to transfer their voting choices to
an electronic ballot marking system, reviewing those choices with the option to
make further changes, before continuing to cast and print the ballot. </p>

<p class=Body>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc460524460">Marking their ballot</a></h2>

<p class=Body>Marking the ballot brings us to the voting system and ways to
support voters, either through external personal AT, whether connected or used
in conjunction with the ballot marking activity.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524461">Connecting personal AT</a></h3>

<p class=Body>The VVSG already allows for personal AT to connect through a
3.5mm jack. Assistive technology that might use this option includes joysticks
and other pointing devices customized for use with specific physical actions. </p>

<p class=Body>There are two challenges. The first challenge is that there is no
standard communication protocol for these devices, limiting the devices that
would work, and potentially disrupting the polling place with attempts to
connect. </p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>The second is that the 3.5mm jack limits the types of
AT that can connect because the more common connections use a USB connector or
Bluetooth, both of which are problematic for voting systems. </p>

<p class=Body>USB to 3.5mm adaptors are available from popular electronics
stores and products designed to make some kinds of audio equipment connect to a
MacBook. </p>

<p class=Body-ListIntro>Research ideas include:</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

</span></span>The MSU paper, <i>The Use of Personal Assistive Technologies in
Voting</i>, includes a detailed description of how intermediary technology or
devices that manage translation between different connectors could be used to
make it easier for a wider range of personal devices in the polling place.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc460524462">Personal braille displays</a> and note-takers</h3>

<p class=Body>While there are no definitive statistics for how many people read
braille, the ability to read braille in the polling place can be useful to those
who rely on them. As with digital skills, even people who have learned braille
have different degrees of competency. In addition, they may prefer braille for
some tasks, but not others. For example, some people prefer it for long-form
reading such as news articles, books, or ballot measure text, but not for
interface tasks. </p>

<p class=Body>For those who do use braille regularly, personal braille displays
or braille note-taker devices are becoming more affordable and available.
Typically, braille displays connect via Bluetooth or USB, but it may be
possible for them to connect to a voting machine using a 3.5 MM to USB adapter.</p>

<p class=Body>Braille displays are important for some blind users who prefer braille
to audio, but critical for deaf-blind voters who rely on tactile input. Connecting
them to a voting system is a challenge for several reasons:</p>

<p class=BodyBulletsCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Lack of a standard “plug and play” connection protocol. They can

<p class=Body>Braille displays would more likely be used as a way to bring

<h3><a name="_Toc460524463">Personal devices for literacy support</a></h3>

<p class=Body>There is a type of personal assistive technology that supports
people with some forms of reading disabilities, including dyslexia, attention
disabilities, low literacy, or low English proficiency. They are most commonly
used to support reading with features that adjust the presentation of the text,
or provide dictionary support. </p>

<p class=Body>This software typically runs as an application on portable device
such as a smartphone or tablet. They include products such as:</p>

<p class=Body>Current products are unlikely to connect to a voting system, but
they might be used in the polling place similarly to braille displays to
support voters as they mark their ballot.</p>

<h3>Portable magnifiers </h3>

<p class=Body>Portable magnifiers are also important in identifying a voter at
the registration desk (see above) and verifying and casting a ballot.</p>

<p class=Body>The final step in many voting systems is to check the ballot and
verify that it is correct before casting it. When this is a paper ballot, this
is a problem for voters with visual disabilities. </p>

<p class=Body>OCR technology can make it possible for voters to verify a
computer-generated paper ballot. This requires the ballot to be formatted in a
way that does not rely on an association of a graphical mark with a candidate

text)</a></h1>

</div>

<p class=Body>VVSG 1.1 says that the voting system must not require voters to
bring any special technology to the polling place in most cases. The discussion
says that it does not “eliminate the need for a voter’s ordinary
non-interacting devices, such as eyeglasses or canes”</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.5in'><b>3.3.1 General Accessibility</b><br>
c. The support provided to voters with disabilities <b>shall </b>be intrinsic
to the Acc-VS. Personal assistive devices of the voter <b>shall </b>not be
necessary to operate the Acc-VS correctly. This does not apply to personal
assistive technology required to comply with 3.3.4b </p>

<p class=Body><b>3.3.3 Audio-tactile interfaces</b></p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>i. The ATI shall provide its audio
signal through an industry standard connector for private listening using a
3.5mm stereo headphone jack to allow voters to use their own audio assistive
devices.</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>ii.  If the ATI utilizes a telephone
style handset or headphone to provide audio information, it <b>shall </b>provide
a wireless T-CoilANSI01 ] American National Standard for Methods of Measurement
of Compatibility between Wireless Communications Devices and Hearing Aids, ANSI
C63.19 9coupling for assistive hearing devices so as to provide access to that
information for voters with partial hearing. That coupling <b>shall </b>achieve
at least a category T4 rating as defined by [[] American National Standard for
Methods of Measurement of Compatibility between Wireless Communications Devices
and Hearing Aids, ANSI C63.19</p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:0in'>            <b>3.3.4 Enhanced input and
control characteristics</b></p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>a. The Acc-VS <b>shall </b>provide a
3.5 mm industry standard jack used to connect a personal assistive technology
switch to the Acc-VS. This jack <b>shall </b>allow only switch data to be transmitted
to the voting system. The voting system <b>shall </b>accept switch input that
is functionally equivalent to tactile input. All the functionality of the
Acc-VS (e.g., straight party voting, write-in candidates) that is available
through the conventional forms of input, such as tactile, <b>shall </b>also be
available through this non-manual input mechanism. </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:0in'>            </p>

<p class=Body><b>3.3.5: Design for Mobility Aids </b></p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>These requirements specify the features
of the Acc-VS designed to assist voters who use mobility aids, including
wheelchairs. Many of the requirements of this section are based on the ADA
Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG). </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>a. The Acc-VS <b>shall </b>provide a
clear floor space of 30 inches minimum by 48 inches minimum for a stationary
mobility aid. The clear floor space <b>shall </b>be designed for a forward
approach or a parallel approach. </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>b. When deployed according to the
installation instructions provided by the manufacturer, the Acc-VS <b>shall </b>allow
adequate room for an assistant to the voter. This includes clearance for entry
to and exit from the area of the voting station. </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>Discussion: Disabled voters sometimes
prefer to have an assistant help them vote. The setup of the Acc-VS should not
preclude this. </p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>c. Labels, displays, controls, keys,
audio jacks, and any other part of the Acc-VS necessary for the voter to
operate the voting system <b>shall </b>be legible and visible to a voter in a
wheelchair with normal eyesight (no worse than 20/40, corrected) who is in an
appropriate position and orientation with respect to the Acc-VS.</p>

<p class=Body><b>3.3.6 Enhanced auditory interfaces </b></p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>c. No voting device shall cause
electromagnetic interference with assistive hearing devices that would
substantially degrade the performance of those devices. The voting device,
measured as if it were a wireless device, shall achieve at least a category T4
rating as defined by [ANSI01] American National Standard for Methods of
Measurement of Compatibility between Wireless Communications Devices and
Hearing Aids, ANSI C63.19</p>

<p class=Body><b>3.3.9 Speech not required</b></p>

<p class=Body style='margin-left:1.0in'>a. The voting system shall not require
voter speech for its operation</p>
