Introduction
   Surveys funded under Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services and conducted by the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) following the November elections in 2008 and 2010 indicated that the biggest obstacle to a blind voter's ability to cast a private and independent ballot is poll workers who do not know how to set-up and operate the accessible voting machine. The Blind Poll Worker Recruitment Program seeks to remedy the problem of untrained poll workers by providing NFB affiliates and chapters, the protection and advocacy system, and other civic and membership organizations with the information and tools to recruit blind voters who have experience using accessible voting systems to serve as poll workers.
 
Why Should Blind Voters Become Poll Workers?
-- In most states, blind Americans have been using accessible voting systems since 2006. The experience of blind voters in the operation of accessible voting systems makes them well-qualified to be poll workers.
-- While most voters take the right to vote privately and independently for granted, blind voters did not have this right until HAVA was signed into law on October 29, 2002. Blind poll workers have a vested interest in ensuring that the exercise of this right is guaranteed to all voters at the polling place.
-- Poll workers get paid. NFB affiliates and chapters can turn working at the polls into a fundraiser by recruiting members to be poll workers and asking them to donate their earnings to the affiliate or chapter.
-- Being a poll worker is an opportunity to serve the local community.
-- Poll workers play a vital role in the democratic process.
 
What Does a Poll Worker Do? 
   Duties may vary by state or county, but generally poll workers:
-- Set-up and close the polling place.
-- Help voters understand their rights.
-- Process the voters.
-- Demonstrate voting procedures to the voters.
-- Assist a voter if requested by the voter.
 
Who is Eligible to be a Poll Worker? 
   Eligibility requirements vary by state and county so be sure to check the eligibility requirements with your state or local board of elections. In general, to serve as a poll worker you must:
-- Be a registered voter residing in the county or city where you will be working.
-- Participate in poll worker training.
-- Please note: some jurisdictions do not permit voters under the age of eighteen to serve as poll workers. Be sure to check age eligibility requirements with your state or local board of elections.
 
How do You Apply to Become a Poll Worker?
-- Visit the Web site of your state or local board of elections. Most boards of elections have a poll worker application form available on their Web site.
-- Telephone your state or local board of elections.
 
How Should a Poll Worker Prepare for Election Day?
-- Expect to serve the entire day including setting-up and closing the polling place. Do not schedule any other events on Election Day.
-- Arrange transportation to and from the polling place ahead of time.
-- Dress appropriately and comfortably--no attire with political affiliations or statements.
-- Bring snacks and beverages to last throughout the day. Meals are not provided to poll workers.
 
How can NFB Affiliates and Chapters and other Organizations Recruit Blind Poll Workers?
-- Hold a poll worker seminar at an NFB affiliate's state convention. Invite a staff member from the state or local board of elections to talk about the need for and duties of poll workers and how to apply.
-- Invite a staff member from the local board of elections to an NFB chapter meeting to talk about the need for and duties of poll workers and how to apply.
-- Publish a recruitment announcement in newsletters, to e-mail lists and to the state's local channel on NFB Newsline. 
 
Conclusion
   The most frequent barrier to voting privately and independently encountered by blind voters is untrained poll workers who do not know how to set-up and operate the accessible voting system. Because blind voters have a vested interest in their right to vote privately and independently and because they are experienced in the operation of accessible voting systems, blind voters who serve as poll workers can help to eliminate this barrier. Using the information contained in this flyer, NFB affiliates and chapters, the protection and advocacy system, and other civic and membership organizations can recruit blind voters to serve as poll workers.
