Lisa Schur and Douglas Kruse1 
 
Key points: 
 
•   Voter turnout surged by 8.5 points in 2018 among citizens with disabilities relative to the 2014 midterm elections.  The surge, though, was slightly larger among citizens without disabilities (11.9 points), resulting in a 4.7 point gap in voter turnout between citizens with and without disabilities in 2018. 
  
•   The increased turnout among people with disabilities occurred across all disability types and demographic categories-gender, race/ethnicity, age group, and region. 
 
•   14.3 million citizens with disabilities reported voting in the November 2018 elections. 
 
•   Employed people with disabilities were just as likely as employed people without disabilities to vote, suggesting that employment helps bring people with disabilities into mainstream political life. 
 
•   If people with disabilities voted at the same rate as people without disabilities who have the same demographic characteristics, there would be about 2.35 million more voters. 
 
These figures are based on analysis of data from the federal government's Current 
Population Survey Voting Supplement for November 2018, which has a sample size of 88,749.  The computations were made using six disability questions introduced on the Current Population Survey in 2008.

     As shown above, among the voting eligible population (citizens age 18 or older), 49.3% of people with disabilities reported voting, compared to 54.0% of people without disabilities.  Within the disability population, the voting rate among people with hearing impairments (57.0%) was higher than the overall voting rate for people without disabilities, and the lowest rate was among those with a mental or cognitive impairment (37.1%).  For each disability group, the difference in turnout from those without disabilities is strong enough to be outside the survey's margin of error.[1]  
 
            As also seen above, turnout dropped slightly from 2010 to 2014 for people both with and without disabilities, but increased markedly in 2018.  The 2018 increase was greater for people without disabilities so the overall disability turnout gap expanded in 2018.[2]   
 
      An estimated total of 122.3 million people reported voting based on this survey, which is close to the total of 118.5 million ballots counted.[3]  Any misreporting is unlikely to differ between the disability and non-disability populations, so the estimate of the turnout gap should be unbiased. 
 
      The estimated 14.3 million voters with disabilities compares with an estimated 15.2 million African-Americans and 11.7 million Hispanics/Latinos who reported voting in 2018, based on analysis of this voting supplement.  It should be noted that the disability total may be understated because these disability measures may not capture several types of disability.[4] Number of voters and non-voters in 2018

      Some of the disability turnout gap may be due to other demographic differences between people with and without disabilities.  When adjusted for gender, race, age, education, and state of residence, the estimated gap expands slightly from 4.7 points to 8.1 points.  This implies that if people with disabilities voted at the same rate as otherwise-similar people without disabilities, there would be an additional 2.35 million voters. 
 
      Also, some of the lower turnout of people with disabilities is tied to difficulties getting to or using polling places.[5]  A variety of states and localities have made efforts to reduce barriers and increase turnout among people with disabilities.[6]  In addition, prior research has found the lower turnout is partly explained by lower levels of income, lower levels of political recruitment, and lower feelings of political efficacy.[7]    
 
      Among the 108.0 million voters without disabilities, 10.2 million lived in a household with a person with a disability.  Combined with voters with disabilities, there were 24.5 million voters in disability households, equaling 20% of all voters. 
Breakdown by employment status and demographics 
 
      Disability turnout grew among all of the employment and demographic categories from 2014 to 2018.  There was no gap in voter turnout between employed people with and without disabilities in either year, indicating that employment helps provide resources and social contact that encourage voting.  The disability voting gap was concentrated among the non-employed, as shown in the numbers below.  The 2018 disability gap was also: 
 
•      larger among women than among men, reflecting especially high voter turnout among women without disabilities; 
•      larger among white non-Hispanics than among other race and ethnicity groups 
•      smaller among the youngest (18-34) and oldest (65+) age groups 
 
      Each of these disability gaps is strong enough to be outside the survey's margin of error except for the comparisons among the employed, Blacks, Hispanics, other race/ethnicity, those in the West, and men in 2014.

Whether voted by mail and on election day 
 
            Among voters with disabilities in 2018, only 53% voted at the polling place on election day, compared to 61% of voters without disabilities.  They were instead more likely to vote by mail before election day (29% compared to 20%), reflecting the mobility problems faced by some people with disabilities.  With the exception of the percentage voting at a polling place before election day, all of these disability gaps are strong enough to be outside the survey's 
margin of error.

State Breakdowns in Voter Turnout 
 
      The voter turnout gap between people with and without disabilities varied by state, as shown in the breakdown below.  It should be cautioned that the sample size is low in many states, which increases the margin of error and decreases the likelihood of finding a disability gap that exceeds the margin of error.  The disability gap in 2018 was large enough to be outside the margin of error (indicated by an "*") in 17 states and the District of Columbia, and was within the margin of error in the remaining 33 states.

Voter Registration 
 
      The disability voting gap is due in part to lower voter registration, but is due more to a lower likelihood of voting if registered.  Among people with disabilities, 66% were registered to vote, only 1.4 points lower than the rate for people without disabilities.  Among those who were registered, 75% voted, which was 6 points lower than for registered people without disabilities.  People with disabilities were more likely than those without disabilities to have registered at a town hall or registration office, public assistance agency, or registration drive, and less likely to have registered at a department of motor vehicles or using the Internet.                                   
                         
      Each of these disability gaps is strong enough to be outside the survey's margin of error, except for the gaps in registering by mail or at a polling place.

Why people were not registered 
 
      The most common expressed reason for not registering to vote, among people both with and without disabilities, was a lack of interest in the election or politics.  About one-fourth of people with disabilities (26%) gave "permanent illness or disability" as their reason for not being registered. 
 
      The disability gaps below are strong enough to be outside the survey's margin of error, except for the small disability gaps in "My vote would not make a difference," "Difficulty with English," and "Other reason."

Why people did not vote if registered 
 
      Among those who were registered to vote but did not do so in November 2018, about two-fifths (41%) of people with disabilities gave "illness or disability" as the reason for not voting, compared to 8% of people without disabilities.  People with disabilities were also more likely to cite transportation problems as a reason for not voting (8% compared to 2%), consistent with their higher rate of voting by mail.  They were less likely than people without disabilities to say that they were not interested, too busy, out of town, or expected inconvenience.

[2] These results cannot be directly compared to elections before 2008 because they are based on a measure of disability introduced by the Census Bureau in 2008.  Using similar measures, studies of prior elections have also consistently found disability turnout gaps (reviewed in Lisa Schur and Meera Adya, "Sidelined or Mainstreamed? Political Participation and Attitudes of People with Disabilities in the United States, Social Science Quarterly 94(3), 2013, pp. 811-839).

[4] The disability questions measure the major sensory, mobility, and cognitive impairments, but may miss some learning disabilities, mental impairments, and physical conditions that do not necessarily limit mobility, such as epilepsy and cancer. 
[5] The Government Accountability Office released a report on June 10, 2009 finding that only 27% of polling places in 2008 had no potential impediments to access by people with disabilities, which was an improvement over 2000 when only 16% had no potential impediments (GAO-09-685). A 2012 household survey found that 30% of citizens with disabilities who had voted at a polling place in 2012 said they encountered difficulties in doing so, compared to only 8% of citizens without disabilities (Lisa Schur, Mason Ameri, and Meera Adya. "Disability, Voter Turnout, and Polling Place Accessibility," Social Science Quarterly 98(5), November 2017, pp. 1374-1390).
