Presentation to National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on the Future of Voting June 12-13, 2017

People with disabilities make up a large portion of the electorate 
 
•         There were about 35.4 million voting-age people with disabilities in the U.S. in November 2016, representing close to 1 out of 6 people of voting age 
 
•         The number and proportion are likely to grow with the aging of the population 
  
•         Almost everybody will have an activity-limiting disability at some point in life  
 
  
 
Data on disability and voter turnout 
•       Census Bureau introduced a new disability measure to the monthly survey in 2008, allowing analysis of over 90,000 voting-age citizens in each national election. • Census disability measure is based on 6 questions that capture major impairments, but may undercount people with mental impairments and certain conditions like cancer and epilepsy. 
Disability and voter turnout in 2008, 2012, and 2016 
                          2008     2012   2016 People without disabilities 64.5%  62.5%  62.2% People with disabilities 57.3%  56.8%  55.9% Disability turnout gap   -7.2%  -5.7%   -6.3%   
 
•       Disability turnout gap is strongly statistically significant in each year (at 99.9% level of confidence) 
•       But the change in disability gaps is not significant across years, so the disability gap is stubborn and not obviously growing or shrinking over time 
         
 
2016 voter turnout by type of disability 
Turnout is lowest among those with cognitive impairments, and those who have difficulty inside or outside the home: 
 
All people with disabilities       
  55.9% Cognitive impairment                 43.5%  Difficulty inside the home         44.5%  Difficulty going outside alone  
  44.7%  Visual impairment                       53.7%                 Mobility impairment                   55.8% Hearing impairment                   62.7%   
Further breakdowns of voter turnout 
•        No difference in voter turnout between employed people with and without disabilities, suggesting positive role of employment in closing disability gap 
•        But majority of working-age people with disabilities are not employed, and their turnout is 
lower than for non-employed people without disabilities 
•        Accompanying fact sheet also shows breakdowns by sex, region, and state 
 
Voting early or by mail 
How voted in 2016                   Disability  No disability Gap At polling place on election day             52.6%                60.9%      -8.3% At polling place before election day      18.1%               19.2%       -1.1% By mail before election day                    28.4%                18.6%       9.8% By mail on election day                             0.9%                  1.4%       0.5%  
⇒Voting by mail may especially help those with mobility problems ⇒But even with option of voting by mail, voter turnout is lower among people with disabilities 
 
Why is turnout lower among people with disabilities? 
Political scientists divide factors affecting political participation into 3 categories: 
 
•        resources ("Are you able to participate?") 
•        recruitment ("Did anyone ask you to participate?") 
•        psychological factors ("Do you want to participate?") 
 
Each category plays a role in the lower turnout of people with disabilities, but gap not fully explained by standard factors 
 
 
Role of polling place accessibility 
Inaccessible polling places impede the ability to vote, and can have psychological effects by sending the message that people with disabilities are not welcome in the political sphere. 
 
GAO report in 2008 found only 27% of polling places were fully accessible. 
--new report on 2016 election is due out this summer 
Rutgers national survey in 2012 (funded by U.S. Election Assistance Commission) 
National household survey of voting-age citizens (2000 with and 1022 without disabilities) found people with disabilities were more likely to encounter, or expect to encounter, problems in voting at a polling place 

                                                                      Disability         No disability 
Voters who reported some  difficulty in voting at polling place           30%             8% 
 
Non-voters who would expect to encounter difficulties in voting          40%             1%

=> Most people-both with and without disabilities-like the act of going to a polling place to participate in democracy with their fellow citizens, rather than marking a ballot in isolation at home. 
 
Potential solutions and best practices 
1.  Increased accessibility of polling places and voting equipment 
 
•        Many states have taken steps to monitor accessibility and correct problems, often with HAVA funds 
 
•        Direct involvement of the disability community helps ensure effective technologies and practices --e.g., people with disabilities assessing potential locations for polling places, doing usability tests of equipment

2.  Mobile voting 
• Bringing ballots or voting equipment to more convenient locations (e.g., where people with disabilities reside) can reach voters who find it hard to get to conventional polling places 
 
 
(cont.) 
3.  Training for election officials and poll workers  
•       A number of states have produced videos, conferences, and programs on accessibility issues  
•       A Missouri study found the most effective training included interactive methods, checklists, and visual aids 
 
(cont.) 
4. Outreach and education for people with disabilities 
•       Several states have distributed information through videos, audio files, booklets, PSA's, and educational events 
•       Often in partnership with disability organizations 
 
 
(cont.) 
5. Voting by mail 
• Evidence shows that "no-excuse" and all-voteby-mail systems are linked to higher turnout among people with disabilities • But 21 states require an excuse when requesting mail ballot, and some people are reluctant to disclose a disability on a public form  
 

Conclusion 
•        Voter turnout is lower among citizens with disabilities 
•        Inaccessible polling places can impede turnout, creating both physical and psychological barriers • Voting by mail not an obvious solution:  most people prefer to vote in person at polling place 
•        Accessible polling places help ensure people with disabilities are fully welcome and included in the political sphere  
•        Many jurisdictions have successfully implemented best practices that help remove voting obstacles and make elections more fully accessible.
