point to larger problems with the United States’ election process and
discrimination against people with disabilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The United Nations General
Assembly (2011) asserts “the right to vote is arguably the most important
political right” (p. 4). Voting allows citizens to shape decisions that can
indirectly and directly effect their quality of life (Agran, MacLean, &amp;
Andren, 2015). For this reason, Agran et al. (2015) call voting “the ultimate
act of American citizenship” (p. 388).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Although election results can
have many direct consequences for people with disabilities, historically they
have been disenfranchised (Beckman, 2007). In the past, many people with
disabilities in the United States were denied the right to vote because of a
requirement of independence, a concept intertwined with ideas of competence and
guardianship (Beckman, 2007). Even today, people with intellectual and
developmental disabilities (IDD) and/or psychiatric disabilities are often
denied voting rights based on restrictions at the state level (Beckman, 2014).
As a result, the application of voting rights for people with IDD is
inconsistent across the United States (Bell, McKay, &amp; Phillips, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>States can bar people with disabilities from voting based on
‘competence’ standards. This disenfranchisement occurs through four main
methods: (1) the use of general guardianship status or a determination of
general incapacity conferred by the court; (2) the court’s restriction of voting
eligibility for specific individuals; (3) the application of outdated
descriptors like “idiots” or “insane persons” to justify voting restrictions;
or (4) the attribution of the status <i>non compos mentis</i> (i.e. not sane or
in one’s right mind) as defined by individual states (Bazelon Center for, 2008,
p. 6). As of 2016, 10 states barred voting by individuals under guardianship,
25 by a voting specific court determination, and four by <i>non compos mentis</i>.
Eleven states had no disability-related restrictions (Bazelon Center for et
al., 2016). People who lost the right to vote based on a state voter competence
requirement may be able to challenge the requirement on the ground that it
violates federal law. Laws that bar people who are ‘mentally incompetent’ or under
guardianship from voting generally violate the Constitution and the Americans
with Disabilities Act if they are used to take away a person’s right to vote
based on disability even if the person has the capacity to vote. These laws,
however, typically require certain people—usually those who are the subject of
guardianship proceedings—to meet standards that are not imposed on other
voters. Probate courts in these states sometimes ask individuals who are the
subject of guardianship proceedings to demonstrate an understanding of
elections and politics that goes far beyond what is expected of the general
public before they are permitted to vote (Bazelon Center for, 2008, p. 12-13).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Recently, however, there has
been state-by-state momentum to ensure people with IDD have voting rights
(Bazelon Center, 2008; 2012; Beckman, 2014; Bell, McKay, &amp; Phillips, 2001).
The voting rights of people with disabilities have changed over time through
legislation and court decisions. For example, successful litigation against voting
restrictions often uses arguments that competence ineligibility violates the
Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment (Bazelon
Center for et al., 2016). The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act also bar discrimination against people with
disabilities, including the denial of a citizen’s right to vote. However, both
the ADA and Section 504 “require an individualized assessment to determine if a
person with a disability is qualified” (Bazelon Center for et al., 2016, p. 8).
Self-advocates have also been pushing to increase people with IDD’s access to
voting. Self Advocates Becoming Empowered (SABE), the largest self-advocacy
group for and by people with IDD, spearheaded the Go Voter movement, providing
training about voting for people with IDD and technical assistance to make
voting accessible for everyone (Go Voter, n.d.). Further, the United Nations
Convention of the Rights on Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) recently
reaffirmed the right to vote for people with disabilities, including those with
IDD (Beckman, 2014; Kjellberg &amp; Hemmingsson, 2013). Unfortunately, even
when people with IDD possess or secure the right to vote, doing so can still be
difficult because of barriers. Large disparities exist between disabled and
nondisabled people, with people with IDD having one of the largest voting gaps
(Schur, Adya, &amp; Kruse, 2013). According to the United States Election
Assistance Commission, these disparities largely derive from barriers to access
(Government Accountability Office, 2009; Schur, Adya, &amp; Kruse, 2013). Of
voters with IDD in the 2012 general election, approximately half reported
polling place difficulties (Schur, Adya, &amp; Kruse, 2013).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Various barriers may make
voting difficult for people with IDD, or prevent them from voting altogether.
With regards to physical barriers, people with IDD may have trouble getting to
a polling place as transportation is a large need for people with disabilities
(Agran et al., 2015; Bell et al., 2001; Belt, 2016; Schur et al., 2013). Not
all polling places are physically accessible for people with IDD who use
wheelchairs or mobility devices either (Schur et al., 2013). Moreover, without
accessible materials people with IDD may have difficulties understanding
ballots or voting machines because of their cognitive impairments (Agran et
al., 2015; Bell et al., 2001; Keeley et al., 2008; Schur et al., 2013; Weiss,
1988). Attitudinal barriers may also negatively affect people with IDD’s
ability to vote. Service providers may not see voting as a priority for people
with IDD because of low expectations about their abilities. However, research
has found people of IDD are capable of making informed decisions regarding
voting (Agran &amp; Hughes, 2013; Agran et al., 2015; Schriner et al., 2000).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>Millions of people in the
United States have intellectual and developmental disabilities (Boyle et al.,
2011). They have the ability to be a powerful voting block that can direct
attention to disability issues that affect millions of United States residents.
Yet, people with IDD remain largely an untapped resource. For these reasons,
this study aims to explore the experiences of people with IDD in the 2016
United States (U.S.) general election. The 2016 U.S. general election, noted
for its heated presidential contest between Donald J. Trump (Republican) and
Hillary R. Clinton (Democratic), was one of the most polarized U.S. elections
to date (Huang et al., 2016). To reinforce that people with IDD are important
constituents who are interested in and capable of engaging in the election
system, our central intent was to explore people with IDD’s engagement – both
as citizens in anticipation of the voting process, and their ideology about the
voting process in general – and to determine the barriers and facilitators to
voting participation for people with IDD as they are key to expanding access
and engagement of people with IDD.  Rather than engaging in a discussion of
which political ideology of people with IDD in the 2016 election, the subject
of another study (see Friedman (2017), this manuscript focuses on the broader
analytical points of this process, linking them to systems and attitudes.</p>

name="_zad11mnbjgnc"></a>Participants</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>This
study took place in Chicago, Illinois. The location was beneficial for such an
exploration of voting experiences because Chicago is complex and multifaced,
both in terms of the general climate and disability community. The study took
place in urban environment in a left-leaning city but one that is located in a
generally conservative state. Chicago is portrayed as a mix of liberal politics
and ‘midwestern sensibilities’; it is also very diverse yet very segregated.
According to the 2000 census, approximately 23% of Chicagoans had a disability
(Facts and Figures, n.d.). However, despite a longstanding and persistent
disability rights and advocacy movement in Chicago, Illinois consistently ranks
as one of the worst states for institutionalization of people with IDD
(Braddock et al., 2015).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0in'>Participants were recruited
via flyers, distributed through self-advocacy organizations, organizations that
serve people with IDD, and the state protection and advocacy agency. Study
information was also distributed through word of mouth. To participate, people
needed to self-identify as having an intellectual and/or developmental
disability, be 18 years old or older, and speak English. Participants received
$30 compensation to help pay for transportation and time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0in'>Thirty-four people with IDD
participated in this study; demographics are presented in Table 1. About
three-quarters of participants (<i>n </i>= 26, 76.5%) voted in the 2016 general
election. Most participants (<i>n </i>= 24, 70.6%) had voted in a government
election prior to 2016. Although participants were not asked about the severity
of their impairments, as a proxy measure they were asked about some of the
skills that can make civic engagement more challenging. The majority of
participants (61.8%, <i>n </i>= 21) reported having trouble understanding
complicated information; about half of the participants (47.1%, <i>n </i>= 16)
also had trouble reading.</p>

groups were held three days after the 2016 general election, November 11, 2016.
Participants first completed informed consent forms and surveys about
demographics. While the majority did so independently, a portion of
participants were supported by the research team or their support person, most
often by having the items read aloud. They were then divided into four focus
groups held simultaneously in separate rooms. A researcher with a doctorate in
disability studies, Carli Friedman and three advanced doctoral students in
disability studies facilitated the focus groups, which lasted approximately one
to one and a half hours. All facilitators had experience doing research with
and/or working with people with IDD. The focus group questions especially
focused on participants’ experiences with voting the 2016 general election,
including any barriers they may have faced trying to vote. Examples of topics
and prompts included:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in;border:none;padding:0in'><b><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>           </span></b>I analyzed<b> </b>demographic
data using descriptive statistics. Focus group data were analyzed using
thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). First, the researcher listened to
the audio recordings of the focus groups and read the verbatim transcripts
becoming immersed in the data. The transcripts were then examined again for
patterns; initial codes were generated based on these patterns. Codes were
grouped into major and minor themes (described below) and revised when
necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;
padding:0in'>            Findings fell into three major themes: 1) Leading up
to the election: decision making; 2) Participating in the election: barriers
and supports; and 3) Future elections: the importance of voting.</p>

<h2 style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;padding:0in'><a
name="_st54fadqajb1"></a>Leading Up to the Election: Decision Making</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Leading
up to the 2016 general election, participants used a variety of different
methods to gather information to make informed decisions when they voted. An
overwhelming majority of participants watched the presidential debates for the
general election. One participant acknowledged, “That’s how I knew what to vote
for, and then I saw the debates I was like ‘okay, now I know who to vote for’.
They really helped me to figure out who I want to vote for.” In addition to
watching the debates, other participants spoke with family and friends. Others
used other media, such as newspapers, local news, and the radio. Social media
also affected the decision making processes of participants. For example, a
number of participants read the articles they found on their Facebook
newsfeeds. Another participant explained YouTube helped him make a decision in
the 2016 presidential election. He added, “YouTube…I was just scrolling down to
see…There are some good videos about what…judging about Trump or Hillary and
all that. I wasn’t sure which one should I pick so that helped me a lot.”</p>

<h2 style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;padding:0in'><a
name="_n03vxfp6587"></a>Participating in the Election: Barriers and Supports</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;
padding:0in'>            Participants faced a number of barriers when trying to
participate in the election process, though some were not necessarily
disability specific. For example, a handful of participants experienced long
lines when trying to vote. One participant noted their were “long lines, like
unemployment.” Another general problem was the lack of information in languages
other than English. Staff had to help a handful of participants translate some
of the text into Spanish because although they spoke both English and Spanish,
reading in English was difficult. However, the majority of the barriers faced
by the participants with IDD were more specific to people with disabilities. A
number of participants were unable to register to vote because they did not
have state identification. In many states voters can register with other forms
of identification, such as a birth certificate or a utility bill that includes
name and address. People with IDD, however, are less likely to have access to
these types of items, particularly if they live in a provider-managed group
home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Although
the majority of participants found voting in the 2016 general election to be
easy overall, they did note a number of basic accessibility barriers. One
participant recommended, “Maybe if they had more places with wheelchair ramps
that would make it easier for people with disabilities.” A group of
participants who went to the polls together also mentioned a lack of signs, which
made it difficult for them to locate their polling place. In addition to being
more physically accessible, the participants also believed that a greater
number of more conveniently located polling places with longer hours would
facilitate voting for people with disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Despite
a number of physical barriers, the majority of participants who used voting
machines found them very easy to operate (e.g., “It was easy for me. It was the
machine;” “I think it was pretty straightforward”). One participant even noted
the machine made things more accessible for her. She explained the machine “was
better” because “my hands shake. I have endpoint trembles [that make writing
difficult].” Another complained that in comparison to the voting machines the
paper versions of ballots can be difficult; the participant explained, paper
ballots “sometimes can be a little confusing or hard. If I mess up I have to
cross it out and get a new one.” Only two participants had trouble with the
voting machines. One participant’s machine kept getting “stuck” and “breaking
down,” while another had trouble because there was a lot of typing required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Attitudinal
barriers also played a role in the voting process of the participants in the
2016 general election. One participant had a negative interaction with the poll
workers that were supposed to help him. He said, the poll workers “were giving
us attitude. They were giving me and my stepmom attitude… I wanted to ask a
question and they were giving me attitude. I was like, ‘I just wanted to ask a
question.’” Ultimately, he decided not to ask his question because of the
experience. Meanwhile, other participants described barriers that were both
institutional and attitudinal. For example, one participant was unable to vote
because his agency support staff did not bring him on Election Day or during
early voting. Although he told his staff ahead of time that he wanted to vote
and the organization was aware of his plans to do so and agreed to facilitate,
on the day of the election his group home staff did not drive him to his
polling place. He explains, “They actually didn’t think it was important to
me.” Although he believed voting was important “to make a change” when asked if
this experience frustrated him he explained, “I didn’t think it would be
nothing to be frustrated about” as if the problem was out of his hands. It is
not uncommon for people with IDD to not be seen as experts about their own
lives; for example, proxy research with family or staff instead of people with
IDD themselves is still prominent in the IDD field. Undervaluing the knowledge
and expertise of people with IDD, whether in research or in their personal
decision making, is common, particularly when it comes to dignity of risk
(Perske, 1972). However, people with IDD have unique experiences and
understandings to which others many not have access; it is critical that staff
and other support people recognize this moving forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Other
participant comments also nodded to the idea that the reason many people with
IDD do not vote is because of low expectations, that is they are not encouraged
to vote because of the attitudes of the abilities of people with IDD. One
participant noted, “They’re probably scared. Not scared but ‘look I don’t know
if I can do it or not…It’s like ‘no try it, you know.’ That’s all that matters.
You need to try and vote, that’s all that matters.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>In
fact, with the right support, barriers were not a problem for participants and
they voted successfully in the 2016 general election. Staff supported many of
the participants in the study by helping them complete paperwork, finding the
polling places, and getting to their polling places. For example, one
participant said, “It was my first time voting and I wasn’t really registered.
So I registered and voted. It was pretty cool. They [staff] were really good at
explaining it. It was really cool.” Another participant noted, “If you can’t
use your hands to vote, you can tell your staff to help you. Do you see what I
mean? Making it for people to make it more easier for them to vote.” A number
of other participants also went voting with their family members such as one
participant who recounted, “When I went to the library [to vote] I had to put a
card in [the voting machine]. I didn’t have no problem with mine, no problem
whatsoever. She [my sister] helped me, and I thanked her for helping me”</p>

<h2 style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;padding:0in'><a
name="_y719hwyzuk3c"></a>Future Elections: The Importance of Voting</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Participants
agreed it is important to continue to vote in future elections. One participant
instructed, “You have the right to vote, and you’re supposed to vote. If you
don’t vote, your vote won’t count.” Another participant proclaimed, “Spread the
word so lots of people with disabilities can be like your vote matters. It will
matter. Or it does matter.” In addition to announcing the importance of voting,
participants also went on to discuss why this is the case. Participants
recognized voting as a mechanism to voice their opinions, captured in
statements such as: “We have the right to speak!”; “You can get your voice”;
and “You ain’t voting for who somebody else told you to vote. You vote because
you want to vote.” They also recognized the role voting plays in shaping the
government. As one participant explained, “[People] just need to get out there
and vote for who they believe in. Who they feel would make the country
stronger.” Another conceded, “We don’t want the president to suck…I didn’t want
to vote at first but I said ‘You know what? I’m going to vote because every
vote matters. You don’t be missing the vote.’” Participants also recognized
that the election’s victor would impact the issues they care about as well as
them directly. Many discussed key issues such as services and supports,
domestic violence, and international relations as factors that determined who
they voted for in the 2016 presidential election (see Friedman (2017)).</p>

<h1 style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;padding:0in'><a
name="_ope5nigne24q"></a>Discussion</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;
padding:0in'><b>            </b>With the proper supports, people with IDD are
willing and able to participate in the voting process. Participants with IDD in
our study actively engaged with the 2016 U.S. general election. They watched
the debates, they spoke with their families and friends, and they researched
candidates via new and old media. In other words, they participated in very
similar ways as the general population. The participants also understood the
impact the election could have on both their lives personally and the larger
direction of the country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:0in;border:none;
padding:0in'>            The majority of participants had few problems when
voting in the 2016 general election. However, parallel with previous research
(e.g., Agran et al., 2015; Bell et al., 2001; Keeley et al., 2008; Schur et
al., 2013; Weiss, 1988), people with IDD faced accessibility barriers in the
2016 general election. Some of these barriers point to larger problems with the
U.S. election process, such as long wait times or a lack of non-English
language information, while others specifically relate to inaccessibility and
discrimination against people with disabilities. Although the majority of
participants did not have trouble with the voting machines or the voting
itself, attitudes, both individual and institutional, served as barriers for
some participants. Support professionals and organizations that serve people
with disabilities either have the ability to facilitate election participation
of people with IDD or serve as gatekeepers that make voting more difficult. In
fact, research has found that organizations can play a key role in increasing
people with disabilities’ ability to exercise voting rights (Friedman &amp;
Rizzolo, 2017). As shown in this study, for many people with IDD, the ability
to vote may hinge on the organization’s commitment to bringing them to the
polls. Unfortunately, because of societal attitudes about people with IDD,
organizations and direct support professionals may not recognize that people
with IDD are not only capable of voting but also are interested in doing so.
Historically, the voting rights of people with disabilities were denied because
of competence. Prior to suffrage women were denied the right to vote under
similar pretenses (Baynton, 2001). However, suffragettes reinforced people with
disabilities’ exclusion in order to win the right to vote, arguing, “They
[women] were not disabled…and therefore were not proper subjects for
discrimination” (Baynton, 2001, p. 34).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>IDD’s
etiology is and always has been intertwined with ideas of competence. Early
constructions of IDD in the United States were tied to “a failure of the will”
(Trent, 1994, p. 16). As a result, IDD was not only pathologized but also
people with IDD were institutionalized and later sterilized (Trent, 1994).
While today there are more complex understandings of people with IDD, the
devaluation of people with IDD is still explicitly and implicitly evident in
the ways that persons with IDD are characterized and discussed (Carlson, 2010).
Such constructions and their overwhelming emphasis on impairment “give rise to
further discourses of <i>personal pathology</i>, of <i>individual difficulties </i>and
of <i>dependency </i>in the face of <i>care</i> (Goodley, 1997, p. 369).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;border:none;padding:0in'>These stereotypes
regarding the presumed competence of people with disabilities carry forward
even today as many states deny voting rights based on ‘competence’ standards
(Bell et al, 2001). One self-advocate explains, people:</p>

</div>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 10.0pt 0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-right:0in'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;border:none;padding:0in'>“Quickly
assume that people [with IDD] don’t have the capacity to understand or know
what’s happening in their lives, or somebody has to help them, or somebody has
to explain it. And that’s not the case. Sometimes that kind of thinking gets
you riled up. We are always needing to explain to people that people are
capable. You know, most other disabilities, people look at people as, ‘Oh, look
what they can do, that’s wonderful. Oh.’ They sort of get amazed. You say a
[intellectual or] developmental disability and, ‘Oh! There’s something wrong,
or that’s dangerous” (Caldwell, 2011, p. 319).</p>

</div>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in 0in 10.0pt 0in'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Thus,
it is not enough for organizational structures to be changed or physical
barriers to be addressed. Stereotypes about the abilities and interests of
people with IDD need also to be dismantled in order for more people with IDD to
have the ability to exercise their voting rights. As their effects can trickle
down to smaller acts such as voting participation, more attention to systemic
barriers is also needed, not only regarding competence (and by extension guardianship)
but also community integration. Although deinstitutionalization of people with
IDD has reached an all-time high, for many people with IDD community
integration is still rare (Braddock et al., 2015; Friedman &amp; Spassiani,
2017). However, changes to these systems are necessary, especially as with
community integration comes choice making opportunities. For example, when
people with IDD have choices about their support staff, they are twice as
likely to vote (Friedman &amp; Rizzolo, 2017).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Our
study has a number of limitations which should be noted, particularly regarding
our sample. Although I paid subjects for participating in focus groups, they
volunteered to participate based on flyers distributed mainly by word of mouth.
As a result, there is a chance of self-selection bias. Moreover, because of the
design of my study participants were required to communicate verbally. Thus,
the experiences and views of people who use nonverbal communication, or have
more severe impairments were not necessarily captured. This study was limited
by a lack of member checking or data review by additional researchers. It
should also be noted that participants were from a large urban area and its
suburbs. Although diverse, the city is solidly Democratic. Moreover, there are
contextual factors, such as the state’s bias towards institutionalization
(Braddock et al., 2015), that may have impacted participant’s ability to and
interest in voting. The 2016 U.S. general election in particular was noted for
its heated presidential contest; as such, participants’ enthusiasm may have
been unique to the 2016 general election. It remains to be seen if the
participants’ enthusiasm for future elections will continue. This passion,
however, is certainly reflected in large segments of the American populace at
the very outset of the Trump Administration. Within the first 100 days of Trump
taking office, the nation has already seen its largest collective protest in
U.S. history, The Women’s March, as well as a surge of people, particularly women,
registering to run for office (Cauterucci, 2017; Gajanan, 2016).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;border:none;padding:0in'>Despite
enjoying participating in the 2016 general election and having an interest in
voting in the 2018 general election, participants had mixed responses when
asked if they would vote in the next local election. While some participants
said they would, others did not think they would. When asked why, one
participant said: “I don’t know [why]. It’s because… I mean not concern me, but
it doesn’t really. I don’t know how you say it, [it isn’t as] interesting to
me.” This finding suggests more education is needed so that people with IDD,
like the general public, understand the important role of non-presidential
elections. Perhaps if the election process is more accessible and relatable for
people with IDD, it will help more people with IDD become engaged. As one
participant admitted, “I wasn’t relating to politics until this election,
[then] I was like ‘okay, pretty interesting!’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='border:none;padding:0in'>Voting is a critical form of
civic engagement because it allows people with IDD to contribute to decisions
that will both directly and indirectly impact their lives. As one of the
largest social minority groups in the United States, if actively engaged,
people with disabilities have enough collective power to draw attention to
issues that could directly facilitate their empowerment and equity of
opportunity. Yet, even among the disability community, people with IDD’s
opinions and participation are often devalued (Charlton, 1998). <span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%'>This study was influenced by the understanding
that people with IDD are legitimate producers of knowledge, especially about
their own experiences and perceptions, </span>they are important constituents
in the election system<span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%'>. Yet, b</span>ecause
of power imbalances people with IDD <span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:
115%'>often need to advocate for their rights, especially rights many
nondisabled people take for granted. Facilitating equity of access to voting
and other forms of civic engagement requires attention to barriers including
structural power inequalities and entrenched ideas about competence “</span>because
every vote matters.”</p>
