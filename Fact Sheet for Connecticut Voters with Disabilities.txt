 
CONNECTICUT SECRETARY OF THE STATE VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES FACT SHEET 
 
ON ELECTION DAY POLLS ARE OPEN FROM 6AM TO 8PM. 
 
ARE POLLING PLACES ACCESSIBLE TO VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES? 
Yes.  The law requires that all voting locations be accessible to voters with disabilities   
I HAVE DIFFICULTY STANDING IN LINE AT THE POLLS.   
Voters who have difficulty standing have several options.  First, they may approach the Moderator and if they wish, request that they be allowed to move  to the front of the line.  Most moderators who see a genuine hardship will be happy to accommodate you.  You may also ask the Moderator if there is a chair you can use.  Your place in line is held and the Moderator or a poll worker will let you know when it is time for you to vote.  Visit myvote.ct.gov, for more info. 
I RESIDE IN A NURSING HOME, ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY OR PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION.  HOW DO I VOTE? 
Registrars of voters are required to visit these types of locations to provide supervised absentee voting, which will be announced in advance.  CT law requires that the Registrar return as many times as necessary to accommodate anyone who wants to vote. So if you are unavailable when the Registrar visits, simply request that she (or he) return and they will do so.  Contact your local Registrar of Voter for more info. 
WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED VOTERS? 
A special computer- based system, with touch screen or audio ballot capabilities is available at each polling location.  This system will read or display each of the choices to the voter.  Once the choices have been made a pre-printed regular ballot will be fed into a printer and the choices marked on the ballot.  The ballot will then be fed through the optical scan tabulator like all other ballots.

MY CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPEAR AT THE POLLING PLACE.  
CAN I VOTE WITH ABSENTEE BALLOT? 
Any citizen has the right to cast their vote by absentee ballot if they meet one of the following reasons: You are an active member of the armed forces of the US; you will be out of town during all hours of voting on election day; your illness prevents you from voting in person on election day; your religious beliefs prevent you from voting on election day; you are preforming duties as an election official at a polling location other than your own; you have a physical disability that prevents you from voting in person on election day.  Visit myvote.ct.gov, for more information and links to the application. 
MAY I ALWAYS VOTE BY ABSENTEE? 
Connecticut law provides for a voter with disabilities to apply for permanent absentee voter status.  You must provide a note by your doctor which is filed at the Town Clerk's office.   These voters will be sent their absentee ballots for each election occurrence in that cycle without having to complete the application form each election.  Visit myvote.ct.gov, for more info. 
I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED WITHIN 6 DAYS OF THE ELECTION AND CANNOT APPEAR AT MY POLLING PLACE.  HOW CAN I VOTE? 
The law provides for an emergency absentee ballot in these circumstances.  You will need to fill out an Emergency Absentee Ballot application and make sure to mark who will be your designee.  Your designee will be the only one that will be able to deliver the absentee ballot to you. Contact your local Town Clerk for more information. 
WHAT IS CURBSIDE VOTING? 
Curbside voting is for voters who are temporarily incapacitated and cannot gain access into the polling place.  In these circumstances the voter may request a ballot be brought to him/her.  Two poll-workers of opposite parties will come outside to assist you.  Visit myvote.ct.gov, for more info. 
I NEED ASSISTANCE CASTING MY BALLOT. 
Any voter may allow someone to assist them in casting their ballot, with some exceptions.  These people that are not allowed to help include:  the voter's employer (or an agent of the employer), an agent of the voter's union, or a candidate whose name appears on the ballot, unless they are a member of the voter's immediate family.
