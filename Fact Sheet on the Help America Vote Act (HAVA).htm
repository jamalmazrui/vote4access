<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Help America Vote Act (HAVA)
programs are designed to establish and improve participation in the election
process for individuals with the full range of disabilities. Signed into law on
October 29, 2002, HAVA assigns responsibility for the administration of the
law’s disability provisions (sections 261 and 291) to the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, who delegated the responsibility to
the Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (formerly
known as the Administration on Developmental Disabilities). Currently, funding
is awarded to eligible Protection and Advocacy Systems (P&amp;As) under section
291 as well as entities providing training and technical assistance to
P&amp;As. In previous years, HAVA funds allocated under section 261 were also
awarded to the Secretary of State or Chief Election Official in each eligible
state or territory.</p>

HAVA grantees make polling places accessible for individuals with disabilities
(including path of travel, entrances, exits, and voting areas), provide
information on the location of accessible polling places, and adopt voting
procedures that enable these individuals to vote privately and independently.
Grantees also educate election officials, poll workers, and election volunteers
on the rights of voters with disabilities and best practices in working with
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>P&amp;As provide assistance to
state and other government entities by surveying polling places, identifying
potential modifications to make specific polling places accessible, and
developing criteria for identifying accessible polling places.</p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Ensuring Full Participation in the Electoral
Process </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.1pt;margin-bottom:
10.5pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>In each eligible state and territory, P&amp;As work
to ensure that individuals with disabilities have the opportunity to
participate in every step of the voting process. P&amp;As educate individuals
about voter registration and their legal rights pertaining to voting, provide
voter registration opportunities, and help individuals access the polls on
election day. Individuals interested in filing complaints may also be assisted
and represented by the P&amp;As.</p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Providing Training and Technical Assistance to
Protection and Advocacy Systems</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Eligible nonprofit organizations
receive discretionary grants to assist P&amp;As in developing proficiency in
the use of voting systems and technologies for individuals with disabilities
and demonstrating and evaluating the use of such systems and technologies.
P&amp;As also receive training and technical assistance for providing
non-visual access in the voting process. These grants are authorized under
section 291 of HAVA as a seven percent set-aside of the total appropriation for
P&amp;As. After receiving training and technical assistance, P&amp;As may
inform others on the availability of accessible voting equipment and its use.</p>
