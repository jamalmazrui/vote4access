the United States. This accounts for a broad range of disabilities, including
mobility, communicative, physical, and cognitive impairments. This ever-growing
population of voters also faces educational, cultural and political barriers
that can make participating in elections even more difficult. The U.S. Election
Assistance Commission (EAC) has a strong commitment to working with both
election officials and voters with disabilities to ensure that the election
process, polling places and voting services are accessible. <span

margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;color:#1F497D'>Why the EAC? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the Help America Vote Act
(HAVA) to reform the voting process throughout the U.S. Through HAVA, the EAC
was created to assist states in improving voting systems and voter access for
all Americans. HAVA also established a clear mandate to ensure that Americans
with disabilities be given the same opportunity to vote freely and
independently as other voters. The bill contained landmark provisions requiring
the secure, private, and independent casting of ballots for voters with
disabilities and entrusted the EAC with leadership in this area.  </p>

disabilities?  </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><b>PROMOTING AWARENESS:</b> Since it was created, the EAC
has worked closely with election officials to promote HAVA’s access
requirements and to foster a climate of understanding in providing assistance
for voters with disabilities. In support of this effort, the EAC also engages
voters with disabilities, who provide vital information that informs election
system and administration improvements. For example, leading up to the 2016
election, the EAC held a widely attended<a
href="https://www.eac.gov/public_hearing_4-27-16/"><span style='color:black;
text-decoration:none'> field hearing </span></a>in Boston, Mass., where voters
with disabilities provided testimony to help the EAC improve the election
process. During its #BeReady16 campaign, the EAC also distributed more than
10,000 federal<a

style='color:black;text-decoration:none'> voting rights cards </span></a>in
Braille, large print, and plain language. The EAC recognizes the importance of
these efforts and that much work remains to be done to reach the full promise
of HAVA. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><b>ELECTION SYSTEM CERTIFICATION:</b> The EAC’s Testing and
Certification program, the most successful and most implemented voting machine
testing and certification program in the nation, works directly with expert
stakeholders to ensure voters with disabilities have access to election systems
that meet stringent national standards. The guidelines significantly increase
overall requirements for voting systems and expand access, including
opportunities to vote privately and independently, for individuals with
disabilities. The next iteration of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG)
contains expanded requirements covering security, reliability, quality,
usability, accessibility, and testing. In order to listen to the voice of
concerned citizens, EAC recently established a <a

factors and accessibility. This group will help in providing universal design
for all future voting systems. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><b>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT: </b>Through the Accessible
Voting Technology Initiative (AVTI), a recently completed $8 million EAC <a

officials and voters with disabilities, the EAC and its grantees produced
approximately 45 R&amp;D technological and administrative solutions designed to
ensure all citizens can vote privately and independently.  </p>

with disabilities?   </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In addition to HAVA, the
following is a list of landmark laws passed to protect voting rights for people
with disabilities:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><b>Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 (ADA): </b>This major civil rights law prohibits discrimination on
the basis of disability in the private and government sectors. ADA enacted a
comprehensive set of national goals to ensure that individuals with disabilities
enjoy equality of opportunity, full community participation, independent
living, and economic self-sufficiency. HAVA expanded these objectives into our
nation’s voting rights. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><b>Voting Accessibility for the
Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984 (VAEHA): </b>This law requires physical
access to polling places used in federal elections. The law also requires
states to make registration and voting aids accessible.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><b>Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA): </b>Section 208 of the
VRA provides assistance for voters with disabilities. Any voter needing
assistance is able to have an individual of their choice accompany them into
the polls. <span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:103%;color:#1F497D'> </span></p>
