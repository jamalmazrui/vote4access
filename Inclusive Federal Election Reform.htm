the right of voting through a secret ballot. However, this right is often
denied to Americans with disabilities and other disenfranchised groups, such as
senior citizens, people from diverse cultures, and those who have low
incomes.   Statistics<sup>1</sup> show that for 35 million voting-aged citizens
with disabilities:</p>

estimated 20,000 of the nation’s 170,000 polling places are inaccessible to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>These statistics highlight the need to improve voting
procedures and systems.  President George W. Bush’s <i>New Freedom Initiative </i>contains
proposals for improving access to polling places and ballot secrecy. Many
proposals to reform the electoral process are currently before the 107<sup>th</sup>
Congress. Voting reform will certainly be considered and likely enacted in time
to affect the 2002 elections. It is imperative that any voting reform law also
provides full access for voters with disabilities, and allows for their private
and independent voting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The major issues for voters with disabilities range from
opportunity for voter registration and implementation of existing laws to the
review of policies, procedures, and practices such as the availability and
dissemination of culturally sensitive information, and universal design. In its
<i>1999 Progress Report</i>, the National Council on Disability (NCD)
recognized the critical need for election reform and reiterated “its challenge
to the President and Congress to enact legislation … [that] would include the
recognition of the right of all individuals to vote independently, guaranteed
accessibility to all stages of the electoral process (from voter registration
to election-day practices), and meaningful technical assistance and enforcement
mechanisms to ensure the right to vote.”  NCD has also noted that “many
election officials are considering moving to a system of voting that would
enable people to vote by computer or through other remote technologies.” 
Although the existing laws for voting have paved the way for more Americans to
vote, they neither include enforcement components nor address in a
comprehensive way the use of current technology, including universal design, to
promote full participation by all citizens.  NCD recommended that these new
systems be made accessible to all people with disabilities  (NCD’s<i> 1997
Progress Report</i>). In its 1999 report, <i>Implementation of the National
Voter Registration Act by State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies, </i>NCD
reported that 75 percent of people with disabilities who received services from
state vocational rehabilitation agencies were never asked to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>register to vote as the law requires.  A 2000 Harris poll
indicates that 42 percent of this group still was not offered the opportunity
to register.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>NCD’s report, <i>Lift Every Voice: Modernizing Disability
Policies and Programs to Serve a Diverse Nation </i>(December 1999),<i> </i>included
accounts of unequal opportunity for citizens from diverse racial and ethnic
groups to access and participate in various areas of society, including voting<i>.</i> 
The National Council of La Raza has raised accessibility issues related to
language needs and the voting process. The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People has publicized findings of voter
disenfranchisement and allegations of discrimination.  The Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights gave recent testimony before Congress that included
the disenfranchisement of citizens, including people with disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Although a Harris poll reported an increase in the number
of people with disabilities voting in the recent Presidential election,
according to the National Organization on Disability, if people with
disabilities voted at the same rate as the general population, there would have
been 3.5 million more votes cast in November 2000.  The overall impact of unmet
accessibility needs of people with identified disabilities, and findings on
other citizens with conditions such as those related to the aging process have
not yet been evaluated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>To effectively address the broad range of issues related to
voting accessibility and to develop strategic actions at the national level,
NCD makes the following four key recommendations drawn from those offered in
its past reports:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='line-height:103%'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
President and Congress must enact federal legislation that incorporates the use
of modern technological concepts and systems capable of ensuring full
participation by all citizens.  Existing conditions, needs, and strategies to
remove barriers must be identified and included in voting reform legislation
with provisions that recognize and support the right of all individuals to vote
independently.  In particular, any voting reform legislation should: (a)
address voting access for people with vision, hearing, cognitive, physical, language,
and technology needs; (b) set uniform federal guidelines and criteria for the
receipt and use of federal funds, including requiring the purchase of
accessible systems only— which would parallel restrictions imposed on the use
of federal funds by the Rehabilitation Act; and (c) require accountability
processes for implementing the guidelines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;margin-bottom:13.5pt;
margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='line-height:103%'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
President and Congress must address complex issues and concerns surrounding
existing federal legislation and effective ways to improve those laws through
amendments or regulatory action.  It is imperative, however, that current
rights and protections are maintained, rather than diminished.  NCD reiterates
its recommendation to amend the 1984 Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and
Handicapped Act to include guaranteed accessibility to all stages of the
electoral process (from voter registration to election-day practices), and
meaningful technical assistance and enforcement mechanisms to ensure the right
to vote<i>.</i></p>

encourages bipartisan national, state, and local voter registration and
get-out-the-vote initiatives for people with disabilities<i> </i>and other
disenfranchised Americans<i>.  </i>Any comprehensive federal voting reform
legislation must incorporate basic provisions for culturally sensitive, ongoing
training and education of public officials, employees, and the general public
about all aspects of voting.  It is also imperative that public service

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
President and Congress must contact key citizens from disenfranchised groups
and include them on any commission or similarly named body to investigate the
status of the full range of voting accessibility issues in America.  Any
dialogue on voting reform issues should include cross-disability and
cross-cultural representation of these stakeholders.</p>
