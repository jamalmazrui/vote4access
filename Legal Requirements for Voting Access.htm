<h2 align=center style='margin:0in;text-align:center'><span style='font-size:
14.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif'>Legal Requirements for Voting Access</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Voting is one of our nation’s most fundamental rights and a hallmark
of our democracy. Yet we continue to struggle to ensure that individuals with disabilities
are able to participate equitably in a fully accessible voting system.  Important
federal civil rights laws are in place to protect the fundamental right to vote
for all Americans including people with disabilities. This document provides an
overview of the legal underpinnings for accessible voting along with questions
and answers about issues critical to ensuring accessible voting.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'>What are the major laws that ensure voting access for
individuals with disabilities?  </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three major federal laws that require voting accessibility
– </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>The <u>Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA)</u> is a federal civil rights law that provides protections to people with
disabilities that are similar to protections provided to individuals on the basis
of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. Title II of the ADA requires
state and local governments (“public entities”) to ensure that people with disabilities
have a full and equal opportunity to vote. The ADA’s provisions apply to apply
to all elections (federal, state and local elections) and all aspects of voting,
including accessible voter registration and voter education materials, polling place
accessibility, and accessible voting (selecting, verifying and casting a ballot),
whether on Election Day or during an early voting process. (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131
et. seq.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'><u>Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act (Section 504</u>) preceded the ADA and similarly provides
that qualified individuals with disabilities shall not be <span lang=EN>excluded
from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,
which includes most all public entities.  (</span>29 U.S.C. § 794) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.3in'>The <u>Help America Vote Act of 2002
(HAVA)</u> requires jurisdictions responsible for conducting federal elections to
provide at least one accessible voting system for individuals with disabilities
at each polling place in federal elections. The accessible voting system must provide
the same opportunity for access and participation, including privacy and independence
that other voters receive. (52 U.S.C. §§ 20901–21145) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'>What are the legal requirements for accessible online voter registration
and voter educational materials? </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Online services have dramatically changed the way state and
local governments do business.  Online voter registration systems and digital
voter educational materials are becoming more and more common.  As a result,
people can easily access these services (e.g. voter registration and voter
educational materials) seven days a week, 24 hours a day without the assistance
of government personnel.  </p>

<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif'><br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif'><br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<div class=WordSection2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Title II of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and, if
the government entities receive federal funding, Section 504 generally require
that state and local governments provide qualified individuals with
disabilities equal access to their programs, services, or activities unless
doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of their programs, services, or
activities or would impose an undue burden.  This includes access to online
services in the form of online voter registration systems and online voter
educational materials.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ADA also requires public entities to provide equally
effective communication. The purpose of the effective communication requirements
are to ensure that the person with a disability can communicate with, <i>receive
information from, and convey information to</i>, the covered entity (<i>emphasis
added</i>).  Covered public entities must provide auxiliary aids and services
when needed to communicate effectively with people with disabilities.  Auxiliary
aids and services include a wide variety of technologies including
accessibility features in electronic content and electronic and information
technology that is accessible and interoperable with assistive technology such
as screen readers.  To be accessible and interoperable with assistive
technology, online content must meet accessibility standards such as the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 level AA. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>To meet the ADA’s requirements for equal program access
and effective communication, online content must be accessible to individuals
with disabilities.</u>  Please note that the only alternative to making online
content fully accessible is to provide an alternative accessible way for
citizens with disabilities to use the programs or services.  However, there
really is no alternative that will provide an equal degree of access in terms hours
of operation and the range of options and programs available.  For example the
offer of human assistance via telephone during work hours would not provide
equitable access and would create yet another set of potential access barriers
for individuals with certain types of disabilities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To highlight the issue of inaccessible online voter
registration systems, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center
for Accessible Technology published a report that describes widespread access
barriers with online voter registration websites.  See: <a
href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/021915-aclu-voterregonline_0.pdf">https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/021915-aclu-voterregonline_0.pdf</a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Most recently, the ACLU and
others filed suit against New York claiming that the state provides eligible
voters with quick, convenient, and confidential online ways to register to vote
or to change their names or addresses for voting. However, those same
opportunities are denied to eligible voters with disabilities because the
online voter registration system is inaccessible.  For the case filing see: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/eason-v-new-york-state-board-elections-complaint">https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/eason-v-new-york-state-board-elections-complaint</a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While this case is still pending, a stipulation agreement
was finalized in August of 2016 with a list of website coding and structure
changes that would be made by the end of August and mid-September to increase
the level of accessibility in the short-term to support access to the voter
registration system prior to the November election.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'>What are the legal requirements for polling place
accessibility? </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Polling places are found in a variety of facilities, such as
libraries, schools, and fire stations, or churches, stores, and other private buildings.
The ADA requires that public entities ensure that people with disabilities can access
and use their voting facilities. The ADA’s regulations and the ADA Standards for
Accessible Design set out what makes a facility accessible and should be used to
determine the level of accessibility at any facility being considered for use as
a polling place.  The Justice Department’s <a
href="http://www.ada.gov/votingchecklist.htm">ADA Checklist for Polling Places</a>
|<a href="http://www.ada.gov/votechecklstprt.pdf">PDF</a> provides guidance for
determining whether a polling place meets ADA accessibility requirements.  An additional
Justice Department publication, <a
href="http://www.ada.gov/ada_voting/voting_solutions_ta/polling_place_solutions.htm">Solutions
for Five Common ADA Access Problems at Polling Places</a> | <a
href="http://www.ada.gov/ada_voting/voting_solutions_ta/polling_place_solutions.pdf">PDF</a>,
illustrates suggested temporary solutions for several common problems found at polling
places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, if parking is provided at a polling place but there
are no accessible parking spaces, election administrators can create temporary accessible
parking by using traffic cones and portable signs to mark off the accessible spaces
and access aisles.  Portable ramps can be added if needed.  If temporary
measures will not fix an access barrier, and election offices are unable to
make a permanent modifications to fix a polling place access barrier, then the election
office must look for an alternative, accessible polling place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the ADA, jurisdictions must select polling sites that are
or can be made accessible, so that voters with disabilities can participate in elections
on the same terms and with the same level of privacy as other voters.  When an
election office is unable to identify or create an accessible polling place for
a particular voting precinct or ward, election administrators may instead satisfy
ADA requirements by using an alternative method of voting at the polling place. 
While absentee balloting can be offered to voters with disabilities, it cannot take
the place of in-person voting for those who prefer to vote at the polls on Election
Day.  Any alternative method of voting must offer voters with disabilities an equally
effective opportunity to voting in person.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, if the only suitable polling site in a precinct
is an inaccessible building and state law allows, election administrators may provide
“curbside voting” to allow persons with disabilities to vote outside the polling
place or in their cars.  In order to be effective, however, the curbside voting
system must include:  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:.35in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>signage informing voters of the possibility of voting curbside, the
location of the curbside voting, and how a voter is supposed to notify the official
that she is waiting curbside; </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.35in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>a location that allows the curbside voter to obtain information from
candidates and others campaigning outside the polling place; </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.35in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>a method for the voter with a disability to announce her arrival at
the curbside (a temporary doorbell or buzzer system would be sufficient, but not
a telephone system requiring the use of a cell phone or a call ahead notification
as not all voters have cell phones and cell phone service is not always
reliable in all areas); </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.35in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>a prompt response from election officials to acknowledge their awareness
of the voter (meaning sufficient poll worker staff must be trained and
available to respond quickly even during busy times); </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:.35in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>timely delivery of the same information that is provided to voters
inside the polling place; and </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:.35in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>a portable voting system that is accessible and allows the voter to
cast a ballot privately and independently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Curbside voting is permissible only under the limited circumstances
described above.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'>What are the legal requirements for voting system
accessibility? </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires jurisdictions conducting
<u>federal</u> elections to have a voting system (e.g. the actual voting machine)
that is accessible at each polling place.  (Some states mirror this requirement
for accessible voting machines in state and local elections; others do not.) 
HAVA requires that the accessible voting system provide the same opportunity for
access and participation, <u>including privacy and independence</u> that other voters
enjoy.  HAVA specifically identifies the use of a “direct recording electronic voting
system or other voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities” as a
way of complying with the requirement for an accessible voting system.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This reference to “direct recording electronic voting
systems” is an important reminder that the HAVA requirement for one accessible
voting machine per polling place was premised on the assumption that fully
electronic (paperless) voting would be a readily achievable solution to providing
an accessible voting machine.  However, security concerns raised subsequent to
the passage of HAVA led state and local election officials to near total
rejection of paperless electronic voting systems and a return to marked paper
ballots across the country.  This reversion back to paper ballots has created a
set access barriers that have proven doggedly difficult to resolve to make both
private and independent voting a reality for voters with disabilities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'>Why are paper ballots so difficult to make accessible? </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To be accessible, a voting system must support all three
parts of the voting process, marking the official ballot (selecting vote
choices), verifying the official ballot (verifying the vote selections on a
marked ballot) and casting the official ballot (getting it to the place where
it will be counted).  When the official ballot is a paper record, there are daunting
challenges to providing access to the verification and casting parts of the
vote process.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most voting systems that use a paper ballot utilize some
sort of ballot marking device as their HAVA required accessible voting
machine.  Ballot marking devices utilize an electronic interface that allows
voters with disabilities to mark the paper ballot using a wide range of input
and output access features that all work in a digital environment.  Touchscreens,
tactile keypads and other alternative input devices like voice recognition or
switch input can be used to control the electronic interface, navigate through
the ballot, and select vote choices.  Speech (with volume and speed control),
large text size, high contrast text, and synchronized speech and text can be
provided as output access features.  All of these input and output access
features enable a wide range of voters with various disabilities mark a paper
ballot privately and independently.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ensuring accessible verification of a marked paper ballot is
the greater challenge.  Verifying print on paper requires the print (or some
encoding of the marked vote selections) to be converted back into digital
form.  This digital information must then be presented to a voter with a
disability in an accessible output mode along with accessible input navigation
and control so they can verify the marked paper ballot.  This requires some
form of scanning of text and/or codes that must be done in a way that does not
require voters to manually handle the paper ballot (as that creates yet more
access barriers for individuals with motor disabilities).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ensuring accessible paper ballot casting is an equally
vexing challenge.  Once a paper ballot is marked and verified, to be truly
accessible there must be a way to cast the ballot using the electronic
interface with the input and output access features.  This requires some kind
of automatic paper handling mechanism that is controlled through the electronic
interface.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ballot marking devices designated as the accessible voting
system in a polling place will typically provide a reasonable degree of
accessibility for marking a ballot.  Almost no ballot marking devices currently
deployed provide an appropriate degree of access for verification and casting. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'>What access requirements apply to vote by mail?  </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems clear that HAVA did not anticipate the transition
away from polling place voting to vote-by-mail or other remote voting options
that do not utilize a “polling place” when it specifically required one
accessible voting system per polling place.  However, the ADA requirements for
equal access to programs and services and effective communication are
applicable to all voting by mail – when it is the main voting system used by a
jurisdiction or when it is limited to absentee voting.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vote by mail done with paper ballots mailed to the voter and
mailed back might be the most inaccessible voting system in use today as it
provides no access features for marking, verifying or casting a ballot.  Certainly
some individuals with disabilities will be able to receive and open a mailed
ballot, then mark and verify the ballot, and then mail back/cast a paper ballot
privately and independently.  But since each of those steps requires
significant visual and motor skills, a large number of voters with disabilities
(perhaps even a majority) will be unable to vote by mail using paper ballots
without sacrificing privacy and independence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jurisdictions that use vote by mail as the core voting
system must still comply with the ADA’s requirements for equal program access
and effective communication.  Jurisdictions that only offer an accessible
voting machine at a vote center as an alternative to inaccessible mailed paper
ballots have likely created a situation with inequitable access.  Voters with
disabilities must travel to a vote center to vote privately and independently
whereas similarly situated non-disabled voters can vote privately and
independently from home.  Recent court decisions seem to clearly indicate that this
would not meet the ADA requirements for equal program access and effective
communication (see more discussion in remote ballot marking systems below).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020160512B63/HINDEL%20v.%20HUSTED">http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020160512B63/HINDEL%20v.%20HUSTED</a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Minimally a vote by mail system should offer an accessible
digital version of the ballot to provide some level of access to marking the
ballot privately and independently.  The digital file can be delivered via mail
or can be delivered electronically.  If a voter with a disability has their own
appropriate technology that supports interacting with a digital ballot file,
they should be able to mark their ballot privately and independently.  While the
voter will need to print the ballot they marked electronically (and may be
unable to verify it unless they have scanning technology) and will need to
manually mail the marked paper ballot back to cast their vote (which they may
be unable to do privately and independently) – this still provides more access
than only a mailed paper ballot.  </p>

<h3><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Verdana",sans-serif;
color:windowtext'>Do remote ballot marking systems provide accessibility?  </span></b></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remote ballot marking systems can and should provide accessibility
similar to the delivery of an accessible digital file as described previously. 
Remote ballot marking systems provide an electronic interface that allows a
voter to mark their ballot using either access features built into the
application and/or the voter’s own assistive technology provided the
application is developed in conformance with recognized access standards, i.e.
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, most remote ballot marking systems stop when the ballot
marking process is complete and require the voter to print the marked ballot and
returned it by mail.  As a result, remote ballot marking systems typically have
the same access barriers as voting by mail using a digital ballot.  They do
however have the advantage of providing an electronic interface with some
built-in access features for voters with disabilities who do NOT have their own
technology and assistive technology to use at home.  If the security concerns
could be resolved and a marked ballot could be left in digital form and
returned electronically, the remote ballot marking system would be able to
offer a truly accessible voting process.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remote ballot marking devices have been the focus of recent
litigation to ensure accessibility is available to voters with disabilities. 
The highest profile case to date was decided in February 2016 by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in National Federation of the
Blind et al. vs. Linda H. Lamone et al.  This decision held that Maryland's
absentee voting program which requires voters to mark their ballots by hand,
denies individuals with disabilities who cannot hand mark their ballots,
meaningful access to absentee voting in violation of the ADA and the
Rehabilitation Act.  The American Bar Association provides a summary of the
case and a link to the full ruling at </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More recently, a United States District Court in Ohio ruled
that the <u>immediate</u> implementation of proposed ballot marketing tools (in
time for the 2016 general election) without first complying with Ohio’s
certification requirements would be a fundamental alteration of the Ohio voting
system and thus was not required under the ADA.  This May 2016 decision relied
heavily on the Maryland ruling and affirmed that providing only the option of
hand marking absentee paper ballots was discriminatory under the ADA.  However,
the fundamental alteration exclusion of the ADA provided relief in this case and
Ohio was not required to bypass the state’s voting system approval process to quickly
deploy a remote ballot marking system as a reasonable accommodation.  The court
concluded the ruling by encouraging “<i>both Plaintiffs and the Secretary of
State to continue to work on this issue and determine if such software could be
implemented for future elections”.  The full case decision can be found at </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This recent spate of litigation on remote ballot marking
systems suggests that providing accessibility for vote-by-mail and absentee
voting will be a critical issue for all voting jurisdictions consider carefully
for future elections especially as more and more states increase usage of mail-in
and remote voting options.  </p>
