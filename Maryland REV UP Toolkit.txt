Dear Disability Rights Advocates:
There are approximately 57 million Americans with disabilities. People with disabilities represent 15% of the total voting population.
However, in the 2012 election: 
−     57.2% of people with disabilities DID NOT VOTE!
−     30% of people with disabilities said they wanted to vote but were unable to
   −    72% of polling places WERE NOT ACCESSIBLE!
 
The November 8th election will be one of the most important elections in over a decade.
The disability community-people with disabilities, family members, attendants, providers, professionals, advocates and supporters-has a major stake in the outcome of this election.
The Disability Vote can make a difference on issues such as:
*         Adequate funding and coverage for Medicaid acute and long term services and supports.
*         Waiting lists for home and community services.
*         Integrated employment at no less than minimum wage.
*         Accessible, affordable, integrated housing.
*         Any many more issues! 
We need your help to register voters, help voters understand the voting process, and get voters to the polls and overcome any barriers to exercising the right to vote.  
Use this toolkit to:
 
 
*         Register! Educate! Vote!
*         Use your Power!

 

Marylanders with disabilities CAN influence the outcome
 of the General Election in November
 
 
'More than any time in memory:
> Elected leaders and political candidates are recognizing the 57 MILLION Americans with disabilities-from birth to advanced age-as a powerful, important constituency
> Issues important to people with disabilities must be part of the platform for any candidate running for public office.
 
Join thousands of Americans with disabilities in this important and historic effort!
Don't Mourn...Organize, Register, and VOTE!
Onward to November 8, 2016! Make the DISABILITY VOTE Count!

Voter Bill of Rights
As a Marylander Voter, you have the right to:
 
Vote in an accessible polling place.  Call your local board of elections or check on-line at http://www.elections.state.md.us/voting/accessibility.html to find out if your polling site is accessible to you.  The on-line polling site locator will also confirm that you are registered.  To request an accessible polling site contact your local board of elections by close of voter registration. 
 
Vote at an early voting center in the county where you live.  To find an early voting center near you, go to:  http://www.elections.state.md.us/voting/early_voting.html
 
Vote by Absentee Ballot.  Any registered voter may request to vote by Absentee Ballot.  To get an application and to check deadlines, go to: http://www.elections.state.md.us/voting/absentee.html
 
Cast a private and independent ballot. 
 
Receive voting assistance if needed.  You may ask an election judge for help, or bring any other person to help you except your employer or union official. 
 
Mark a ballot on an accessible voting machine.  You may select a large print or high contrast ballot.  You may also request an audio ballot, which requires the use of headphones and a keypad.  The angle of the voting machines can also be adjusted for better access.

Vote a provisional ballot if your name does not appear on the voter registration list or there is a question about your eligibility to vote.

A Basic Guide to Polling Place Accessibility
 
This is a basic guide to accessibility to assist in identifying barriers and potential solutions to ensure access to voters with disabilities. Election officials should try to select fully accessible polling places and conduct the full Department of Justice accessibility survey.
 
Parking and Drop-Off Areas
*         If parking is provided, at least one accessible parking spot that is nearest to the accessible entrance must be provided for every 25 regular parking spaces.
*         The first accessible spot should be van accessible with an access aisle at least 8ft wide.
*         Accessible parking spots should be relatively level and not have loose gravel or dirt.
*         If drop-off area is provided, it should be level and have an access aisle that is at least 5ft deep and 20ft long where people can access entrance (near ramp if necessary).
 
Solutions: Traffic cones can be used to mark accessible parking spaces and access aisles. Heavy duty mats can be used to level out uneven surfaces.
 
Paths of Travel
*         There must be an accessible path from parking spot to entrance and voting area.
*         Path must be at least 36 inches wide and free of steps or level changes more than 1/2 inch.
*         If accessible path crosses traffic, a marked crosswalk should be used.
*         Where path crosses curb, a curb cut or temporary ramp should be used.
*         Ramps can't be steep. For every 1 inch high, a ramp must be at least 12 inches long.
 
Preventing Obstructions for Voters Who are Blind or Have Low Vision
*         People who are blind can easily run into objects that hang from above (ex. tree limbs), are open beneath (ex. staircases), or protrude from the side (ex. trophy cases).
 
Solution: Place a barrier within 27 inches of the floor so cane can detect the obstruction.
Entrance to Polling Place and Voting Area
*         Doorways must be at least 32 inches wide.
*         Threshold must not be more than 3/4 inches high at door and must be beveled on each side.
*         No heavy doors.
*         No slick, round door handles.
 
Solutions: If door is too heavy to open easily, adjust door closer, disconnect operating arm, or prop door open on Election Day. If smooth round handles are on door, use temporary hardware or prop door open. If threshold is two high, use temporary threshold ramp on each side that is too high.
 
Voting Area
*         An accessible voting machine on wheelchair accessible booth should be located along an accessible path in a location that ensures privacy.
