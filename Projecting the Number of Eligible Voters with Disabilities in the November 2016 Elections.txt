      The number of eligible voters with disabilities is growing with the aging of the population and advances in medical technology.  This brief report summarizes projections of how many people with disabilities will be eligible to vote in the November 2016 elections, based on analysis of data from the Census Bureau's 2010-2014 American Community Survey combined with Census Bureau population projections. The methodology is described at the end of the report. 
The key findings, as shown in Table 1 and pictured in Figure 1, are: 
•      A projected 35.4 million people with disabilities will be eligible to vote in the 
November 2016 elections, representing close to one-sixth of the total electorate.   
•      The number of eligible voters with disabilities has increased 10.8% since 2008, compared to an increase of 8.5% among eligible voters without disabilities.   
•      There will be 62.7 million eligible voters who either have a disability or have a household member with a disability, more than one-fourth of the total electorate. 
 
Table 2 provides a breakdown by major type of disability.  These figures show that 
•      Mobility impairment will be the most common disability in November 2016.  A projected 20.2 million eligible voters will have mobility impairments, 12.2 million will have cognitive impairments, 10.6 million will have hearing impairments, and 6.3 million will have visual impairments.  (Note that these groups overlap since a person may have more than one type of disability.) 
Breakdowns by age, sex, and race/ethnicity in Tables 3 and 4 show that: 
•      Despite senior citizens having a higher likelihood of disability, there will be more eligible voters with disabilities under age 65 (19.3 million) than there are age 65 or older (16.0 million). 
•      There will be slightly more women (18.5 million) than men (16.8 million) among eligible voters with disabilities. 
•      The eligible voters with disabilities will include 25.2 million non-Hispanic whites, 5.1 million blacks, and 2.6 million Hispanics/Latinos. 
•      The total number of eligible voters with disabilities (35.4 million) exceeds the total number of eligible voters who are black (28.7 million) or Hispanic/Latino (29.5 
million). 
•      Mobility impairments are the most common type of disability in each group except for the youngest (age 18-34), among whom cognitive impairments are the most common type of disability. 
Breakdowns by college education, marital status, and personal income in Table 5 show that: 
•      There will be 5.9 million eligible voters with disabilities with college degrees, representing 8.8% of all eligible voters with college degrees. 
•      While about half of all eligible voters are married with a spouse present, less than  half of eligible voters with disabilities are married with a spouse present (14.9 million).  Eligible voters with disabilities are more likely to be separated, divorced, widowed, or never married (20.5 million total). 
•      People with disabilities are disproportionately likely to be low-income.  The rate of disability is 21.8% among all individuals with less than $25,000 in personal income, and is only 6.2% among all individuals with more than $100,000 in personal income. 
Finally, breakdowns by region and state in Tables 6 and 7 show that: 
•      The South has the highest number (14.3 million) of eligible voters with disabilities, as well as the highest rate of disability among all eligible voters (16.8%), while the 
Northeast has the lowest number (5.9 million) and percent with disabilities (14.7%).   
•      Consistent with the above regional pattern, the states with the highest rate of disability among all eligible voters are West Virginia (24.1%), Kentucky (21.2%), Arkansas (21.1%), and Mississippi (21.0%). 
 
      These figures show that people with disabilities constitute a sizeable share of the electorate, so their votes could influence election outcomes.  A key question of course is how many of them will actually vote.  Despite the barriers often faced by people with disabilities in exercising the right to vote,1 estimates from another government data source show that a 
                                                             
1 Among those who voted in a polling place in 2012, 30% of voters with disabilities reported some type of difficulty in voting, compared to 8% of voters without disabilities (Lisa Schur, Meera Adya, and Douglas Kruse, Disability, Voter Turnout, and Voting Difficulties in the 2012 Elections, report to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, June 2013, at http://smlr.rutgers.edu/research-centers/disability-and-voter-turnout).  See the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) report at http://gao.gov/products/GAO-13-538SP, and the White Paper prepared by 
Schur for the 2013 Presidential Commission on Election Administration at 
https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/08/Disability-and-Voting-White-Paper-for-Presidential-CommissionSchur.docx_.pdf.   
majority of people with disabilities reported voting in 2012, and their reported voter turnout was only 5.7 percentage points lower than among citizens without disabilities.[1]  How many will actually vote depends on the dynamics of the 2016 campaign, get-out-the-vote efforts, and extent of voting barriers facing people with disabilities.  Regarding political preferences, the limited prior evidence indicates that people with disabilities are similar to those without disabilities in patterns of party identification and placement on a conservative-liberal scale, but are more likely to favor a greater government role in health care and creating employment opportunities.3 
 
Methodology 
      These projections account for trends in age, sex, and race/ethnicity by using Census Bureau population projections broken down by these characteristics, combined with disability information from the American Community Survey.[2]  Four race/ethnicity groups were created (white non-Hispanic, Black, Hispanic, and other), and the full set of permutations with sex and single years of age (18-85, with 85+ combined into one category) created population projections for 544 demographic groups.  The 2010-2014 American Community Survey, which has a total of more than 12 million observations for individuals age 18 or older, was then used to calculate the percent of non-citizens, institutionalized people, and people with disabilities among noninstitutionalized citizens, in each of these demographic groups.  The Census projections for each group were adjusted for the estimated number of non-citizens and institutionalized people in order to estimate projected number of eligible voters in the total population. Within each group, the disability rate was multiplied by the projected number of eligible voters to derive projections for eligible voters with and without disabilities in 2016 and 2017.  Since the Census Bureau provides projections for July 1 of each year, we estimated the November 2016 population by adding one third of the difference between the 2016 and 2017 projections (representing 4 months) to the 2016 projection.  The Census Bureau does not do population projections by state, so the state and regional numbers in Tables 6 and 7 are based on our projections of eligible voters with and without disabilities separately in each state using 2010-2014 data in the American Community Survey, adjusted to sum to the national projections. 
      Estimates of disability vary by survey, depending on the questions used to identify disability, the defined population, and the survey method and context.  Using more extensive questions, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) yielded a 2010 total estimate of 56.7 million people with disabilities, of which 51.5 million were age 15 or older but an unknown number were eligible to vote.[3]  The Current Population Survey (CPS) uses the same questions as the American Community Survey but has a different survey method and context, and yielded a 2012 estimate of 27.5 million citizens with disabilities age 18 or older.[4]  The 20102014 American Community Survey, which yields a disability prevalence between the SIPP and CPS numbers, was chosen for this report because it has more recent data than SIPP and a far larger sample than either the SIPP or CPS for generating reliable numbers to apply to Census population projections as described above.7
