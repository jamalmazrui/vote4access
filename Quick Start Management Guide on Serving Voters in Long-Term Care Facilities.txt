The Quick Start Management Guide on Serving Voters in Long-Term Care Facilities is part of a series of brochures designed to highlight and summarize the information contained in the chapters of the U.S. election Assistance commission's (eAc) Election Management Guidelines (EMG). Additional voting accessibility issues are explored in current and future eMG publications. the goal of the eMG is to provide a collection of election management guidelines, consolidated into one document, to assist State and local election officials to effectively manage and administer elections. these guidelines are solely designed to serve as a source of information for election officials and not as requirements by which they must abide.
the content of the eMG and the Quick Start Management Guides has been developed in collaboration with State and local election officials and other election professionals who have first-hand experience managing elections. the eAc is grateful for their participation and ensuring the guidelines are practical and applicable for jurisdictions regardless of their size and resources. the eMG and the Quick Starts are available online at www.eac.gov.

Introduction
In the November 2006 general elections, 63% of adults aged 65 and older voted; this age group made up 17% of the voting age citizen population and 23% of the population that actually voted.2  As noted above, this segment of the population is projected to increase 147% between 2000 and 2050.

November 2006 (issued June 2008)
In addition, the congressional research Service has reported that "two-thirds of the people receiving long term care are over 65, an age group expected to double by 2030. After 2030, even faster growth rates are anticipated for people over 85, the age group most likely to need care." the administration of elections must, therefore, develop and implement policies that facilitate registration and voting processes for elderly voters and voters with disabilities, including those in long-term care facilities. these policies must include safeguards to preserve and protect the integrity of the voting process. Following are recommendations to consider when developing these policies; they are based on the actual experiences of States and local jurisdictions that have experience in this matter. Implementation of these policies will vary according to State laws and the local jurisdiction's resources. 
the recommendations contained in this publication should be vetted with Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and relevant case law to ensure they are properly and lawfully implemented; election officials should contact their State officials when there is a question as to whether a practice is permitted or prohibited under State law.
Developing Your Voting Assistance Plan
•               research the number of long-term         care (Ltc) facilities in your jurisdiction;         these include nursing homes and         assisted living facilities. Identify their         location, the services they provide, and         the number of people they serve.  this         will provide useful information for         conducting a general assessment of         the resources you would need to reach 42
        Ltc voters. It would also be beneficial         to learn if any of the facilities serve a         specific disability; this will help you         develop and provide outreach suited to         those particular needs.
Tip: Your State's licensing bureau can assist you with this task.
•               contact your State's election office         and find out what studies or activities         they have conducted or are developing         regarding elderly voters and voters with         disabilities, including those in long-term         care facilities.
Tip: Your State's election office may have an advisory board that addresses accessibility issues. If they have such a board, learn what they do, who their members are, what resources they have, and how you can directly participate or be kept updated about their activities.
•               contact the Ltc facilities and ask to         speak to their director or activities         manager; if you can, set up an in        person meeting. the goal of this         meeting or conference call is to find out         what has been done in the past at each         facility to provide voting services,         whether by community groups or the         facility itself, and to learn how willing         they are to allow your office to come in         and provide services. Questions you         may want to ask during this         conversation are, but not limited, to:
-              What successes and challenges                did they experience in the past? 
 
-              What formal or informal procedures                do they have for handling their                clients' registration and voting                needs? For example: do they                periodically announce voting                information or is it only upon             request; do they have a dedicated             staff member to handle voting             inquiries; do they allow outside             groups to conduct voter registration;             have they ever received formal             training about registration and voting             procedures in your State and local             jurisdiction; how do they manage             absentee ballots requests; how do             they assist voters to cast their             ballots; etc.
-              Would they be willing to participate             in a more formal meeting with your             office, other care providers, and             interested groups/individuals to             discuss the development of             jurisdiction-wide initiatives to             provide uniform and consistent             registration and voting services to             voters in Ltc facilities?
-              Ask the director or activities manager            to identify the Ltc staff who can             serve as your main point of contact             for future communications and             efforts. Having an official point of             contact at each facility will help you             build your partnerships and ensure              receipt of any information you             provide them. 
Tip: Designate one employee in your office to serve as the direct communication link with each LTC facility's main point of contact.
•               establish a local advisory board to        assist you in developing, maintaining,         and evaluating your Ltc voting         assistance plan. Small and medium         size jurisdictions can partner up with         several adjoining jurisdictions to         develop a regional advisory board to         help manage the cost and time burden         of managing the board.
                                                                                  6                62
-              Identify organizations and volunteer                agencies that would share your                commitment to this project to serve                on the board. For example, reach                out to your area offices of aging                and disability, nursing home and                independent living center                associations, ADA chapter,                veterans associations, retired and                senior volunteer organizations,                League of Women Voters, local                colleges and universities, and local                government officials. 
Tip: Consider hiring a project manager to identify and recruit these organizations, develop the board, and help administer it. They could also help develop additional boards/taskforces that address other voter populations or issues.
-              establish membership criteria,                including terms of no more than                two years, with a commitment of                no more than 2-4 hours for                quarterly meetings. 
Tip: Take minutes of the board meetings and distribute them to local media and elected officials.
•               As you begin to design your voting        assistance plan, make sure that your         goals and objectives are clear,           measurable, achievable, realistic, and         time-bound (always refer to the         election calendar to identify the best         time to implement the different action         steps in your voting assistance plan). 
Tip: Plan in advance! A good plan is one     that builds in to its design ample time to implement strategies and correct them if necessary. This also allows care providers and other community partners time to make any changes necessary to their policies or procedures to implement your plan; the goal is to work as a team with the facility staff and to build your schedule to coincide with the activity schedule of the care facility.
Outreach and Implementation 
Strategies
the types of services local jurisdictions will be able to provide to voters in Ltc facilities will depend on the resources available to them (e.g. funding, staffing, volunteers, cooperation of Ltc facilities and other stakeholders, etc.).
•               Provide a calendar of voting deadlines         to each Ltc facility. the calendar         should have, at a minimum, information         on deadlines for: voter registration,         absentee ballot requests, submitting         absentee ballots, early voting (include         dates and locations), special voter         registration drives, and the date the         election will be held. 
Tip: Ask your contact at the LTC facility to share this information with all staff members and visibly display it in general areas and/or distribute it to each resident.
•               recommend the registration of         residents as a part of each facility's         regular intake process. Incorporate         voter registration applications and         information about the voting process         into each of the Ltc facility's resident         welcome packets.
2 8
•               establish a partnership with the Ltc         facilities to hold voter registration drives         on special patriotic days (e.g. Fourth of         July, Flag Day, Veterans Day, Presidents         Day, etc.) Use these occasions to         provide hands-on demonstrations on         how to complete absentee ballots and/         or use your jurisdiction's voting         equipment.[1]
•               Provide each Ltc facility a listing of all         residents who are currently registered         to vote. this list becomes the master         list for determining if there are new         residents that would like to register         and/or request an absentee ballot.
•               Provide individualized training to care         facility staff on voter registration and         elections. Develop a training guidebook         that you can distribute to them as part         of training. the guidebook should be         easy to read and understand. examples 
        of information to include in the         guidebook are, but not limited to:
-    Overview of voter registration laws                  and requirements
-    Suggestions on communication                methods to inform residents and/or                their family members about how to                participate in the election process.
-    Deadlines and requirements for                registering to vote, requesting                and/or providing assistance with                voting, including how to request an                absentee ballot. 
Tip: Develop scripts for use by facility directors and staff to ensure that the communication is accurate and consistent.
-    Description of Federal and State                laws on when and under what                circumstances an individual can                provide assistance to voters in                casting their ballot and how to                request a ballot on behalf of a voter.
-    Methods for protecting the security                and integrity of residents' ballots.
-    Information and training on how to               assist voters with special needs. 
Tip:  Engage the LTC facility staff and your local advisory board, if applicable, in the development of voting assistance guidelines that address the various cognitive and physical challenges faced by these voters. This will also help ensure staff or voting assistants do not inadvertently make determinations on a voter's capacity to vote.
-    Include details about how to                change residence/voting address to                another State and/or requesting a                ballot be sent to a temporary                address. 
Tip: Familiarize yourself with the various residency rules pertaining to Medicare/ Medicaid prior to assisting a resident with changing their official residence address.
•               In addition to training Ltc staff,        provide training to community groups         that provide election outreach to voters         in Ltc facilities to ensure the         information they provide is consistent         and uniform with the information         provided by your office. 
Tip: Let the community groups know the dates you will be holding training at the LTC facilities so they may attend as well.  The goal 210
is to build effective collaboration between all groups for the benefit of the voters that receive these services.
•               Develop a Voter Information toolkit for         use at Ltc facilities and independent         living communities.           -   educational videos
-    Voter's bill of rights poster
-    Large print voter registration                applications and absentee ballot                applications
-    "How to Mark your ballot" posters
-    Audio of your local League of                Women Voters voter guide.                   consider providing this information                in languages other than english                based on the demographics of the                facility and in accordance with                Federal language assistance                requirements, where applicable.
Tip: Remember to use large font and bulleted short sentences on posters and informational brochures.
•               Send teams of your office staff or           recruit volunteers to provide voting         services ("mobile polling") to voters in         Ltc facilities. each team should be         comprised of a minimum of two staff         members (of opposite party affiliations,         if required); they must also successfully         complete training prior to providing         services. the training should be similar         to some of the aspects of poll worker         training and the training described         previously for Ltc staff. For example, 
4     the eAc has published guidelines for the effective design of ballots and polling place materials. the best practices contained in the report are based on based on the 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines, research findings, and information design principles. the report is available on the eAc's Web site, www.eac.gov.

        in addition to the elements listed in the         Ltc training, it should include, but not         be limited to, information on:
-          How to complete a voter                registration application, absentee                ballot application, and other forms                required by State law.
-          Information on voter identification                requirements, if applicable. 
Note: The training should include how to assist residents with acquiring and/or locating acceptable identification for voting purposes.
-          Details on where to pick up ballots                and supplies; managing supplies                on-site, including security of voted                ballots; and delivery and return of                all supplies and voted ballots.
-          training on how to use voting                equipment, if applicable. 
Note: Election officials will have to decide if the mobile polling teams will use absentee ballots or take voting equipment along to assist residents to vote. This decision will impact how the voting assistance will be provided.
   • If an Ltc facility is used as an election       Day polling place, the following must be       considered:
          -   the facility should only be used for                voting by the Ltc residents (i.e. it                is its own precinct).
                       n   If it MUSt be used as a polling                     site for area residents, then it                     must be set up in a manner that
 
5     HAVA §301(a)(1)(b)(ii) requires jurisdictions that use a paper ballot system, including mail-in absentee ballots and mail-in ballots, to provide voters with "instructions on how to correct the ballot before it is cast and counted (including instructions on how to correct the error through the issuance of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to change the ballot or correct any error).
212
                    does not interfere with Ltc                     services and resident traffic                     patterns, and it must give                     priority to the medical needs                     of the residents.
-              Will the designated voting area                interfere with other resident                services?
-              Is the voting area laid out to                accommodate voters that require                wheelchairs or other walking                assistive devices?
-              How will the site be managed and                staffed to avoid long wait lines?
-              How will assistance be provided to               voters that are bedridden?
-              electioneering and poll watching                rules need to be in effect as they                would in any other polling place.
