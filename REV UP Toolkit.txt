Dear Disability Rights Advocates:
In July 2015 we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
We can take great pride in the historic advances we have made in the community integration of people with disabilities of all ages since the passage of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. No matter what the issue- education, housing, transportation, personal assistance services, employment, recreation, adaptive technology, durable medical equipment, or health care, we can see the advances that have improved our lives and moved us closer to true equality.
This has come about by working together and implementing a strategy that has included legislative, legal, direct action, and educational tactics. These tactics are part of our overall goal to bring about the community integration promised in the ADA.
We cannot rest on our past victories. We must build on the past and move forward using the power we have acquired. This power can be exerted if we Make the DISABILITY VOTE Count! Policymakers are influenced by large numbers of people turning out to vote in the primaries and the general elections. This reality is why we started the REV UP Campaign.
The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) is a convener, connector, and catalyst for change, increasing the political and economic power of people with disabilities. The focus of the REV UP Campaign is to get more people with disabilities and our supporters registered and voting!
This Toolkit is designed to help you begin organizing in your state. Effective REV UP Campaigns will convene state and local disability organizations, such as centers for independent living (CIL) and protection and advocacy (P&A) organizations, to amplify this message and reach more people with disabilities. 
If you need assistance getting connected to CILs or P&As in your state please contact AAPD at communications@aapd.com. We'll be happy to make an introduction.
 
 
Register! Educate! Vote!
Use your Power!

*         Consolidation and closure of public institutions.
*         Integrated employment at no less than minimum wage.
*         Accessible, affordable, integrated housing.
*         Adequate funding for quality public and higher education.
*         Quality Medicaid managed care with strict accountability measures.
*         Recruitment and retention strategies for improved wages and benefits for community attendants.

How do I register to vote?
*         By mail - Just get a registration form, fill it out, and mail it in. It is free.
*         In person -- Register at a voter registration agency.
 
Where can I get a registration form to mail in or register to vote in person?
They are available in many languages. They are available at the following places: [Note: there may be some differences from state to state]
*         All Department of Public Safety offices (where you go to get a driver's license)
*         All county voter registrar offices (In most counties, the office is part of the county tax assessor- collector's office, but in some counties, it is part of the county clerk or elections administrator's office. You can ask the county courthouse for the office location.)
*         The Secretary of State's Office (or call them at [insert state phone number])
*         Public libraries
*         Many post offices
*         Many high schools
*         On the internet at: [insert web address]
*         Any office of a state agency that provides public assistance (Department of Transportation, Workforce Commission, Local Workforce Center, etc.) 
*         Any office that provides state-funded programs that help people with disabilities (Department of Aging and Disability Services, Department of State Health Services, Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, etc.)
The offices that have the registration forms must also help you complete the forms, unless you refuse assistance.
In addition, political parties, activists groups, and private citizens can give out application forms. If they do, they must help you register, too, whether or not you agree with their politics or point of view.

If I am registering by mail, do I need to send anything else in besides the form?
No, not unless this is the first time you have registered to vote. First-time voters must also send in a photocopy of identification along with their registration form. Acceptable ID includes: A driver's license; bank statement; utility bill; paycheck; or other government document that shows your name and address.
Note: If you chose not to send in a copy of identification when registering to vote as a first time voter, you will be required to show identification at the polls when you go to vote for the first time.
 
What is the deadline to register to vote for an upcoming election?
*         You must register 30 days before an election to be eligible to vote in that election.
*         If you are registering by mail, your application form must be postmarked at least 30 days before the election.
 
What if I have a disability and can't leave the house?
*         You can either register by mail, or
*         If an agency is providing you with services in your home, and if they offer voter registration services, they must provide those voter registration services at your home.
 
What if I am staying in a hospital or other institution that is not in my home county?
If you reside in an institution, or somewhere else that is not in the same county as your permanent address, you can register to vote by mail in the county where your permanent address is. Then you can vote at your current residence with a vote-by-mail ballot. (See handout on Alternative Voting Options.)
 
What if I need help to register?
Anyone of your choice can help you register. Anyone you choose may fill out the registration card for you, in your presence. If you cannot sign you name, you may have a "witness" sign on your behalf. If you can make a mark of any kind, do so, in the signature line. Have your "witness" sign and date their name under the signature line, to indicate that they acted as your witness.
 
Is there a way to find out if I am already registered to vote?
You can call the Secretary of State's office at [insert state phone number]. This is the same number you would call to request an application by mail or to seek answers to any voting related question.
 
What happens after I register?
*         Once you submit a voter registration application, a voter registration certificate (proof of registration) will be mailed to you within 30 days.
*         Voter Registration Certificate - Check your certificate to be sure all information is correct. If there is a mistake, make corrections and return it to the voter registrar immediately.
*         When you go to the polls to vote, present your certificate as proof of registration. Remember, if you did not present identification when registering to vote as a first-time voter, the poll worker will also ask you to show identification along with your certificate.
*         If you do not have your certificate you may vote without it by signing an affidavit at the polling place and showing some other form of identification (driver's license, birth certificate, copy of electric bill).
*         If you lose your certificate, notify your county Voter Registrar in writing to receive a new one.
*         You will automatically receive a new certificate every two years, if you haven't moved from the address at which you are registered.
 
How do I make changes to my voter registration certificate?
If you move within the same county, promptly notify the Voter Registrar, in writing, of your new address by:
*         Correcting your current voter registration certificate on the back and returning it to the Voter Registrar;
*         Filling out a new voter registration application form and checking the "change" box;
*         Making simultaneous changes to your driver's license and voter registration when you apply for or update your driver's license;
*         Request changes to your name and/or address on your voter registration card online at [insert web address]; or 
*         Contact any of the designated voter registration offices.
You will receive a new certificate with your new address. You will be able to vote in your new precinct 30 days after your change of address is submitted.
 
If you move to another county:
*         You must re-register! Fill out a new application and mail it, or take it in person, to the Voter Registrar of your new county, or register in any way that is listed above. You will be registered 30 days after your application is submitted. You will receive a new certificate.

*         You will receive a new certificate 30 days after your name change notice is submitted.

A Basic Guide to Polling Place Accessibility
 
This is a basic guide to accessibility to assist in identifying barriers and potential solutions to ensure access to voters with disabilities. Election officials should try to select fully accessible polling places and conduct the full Department of Justice accessibility survey.
 
 
Parking and Drop-Off Areas
*         If parking is provided, at least one accessible parking spot that is nearest to the accessible entrance must be provided for every 25 regular parking spaces.
*         The first accessible spot should be van accessible with an access aisle at least 8ft wide.
*         Accessible parking spots should be relatively level and not have loose gravel or dirt.
*         If drop-off area is provided, it should be level and have an access aisle that is at least 5ft deep and 20ft long where people can access entrance (near ramp if necessary).
 
Solutions: Traffic cones can be used to mark accessible parking spaces and access aisles. Heavy duty mats can be used to level out uneven surfaces.
 
 
Paths of Travel
*         There must be an accessible path from parking spot to entrance and voting area.
*         Path must be at least 36 inches wide and free of steps or level changes more than 1/2 inch.
*         If accessible path crosses traffic, a marked crosswalk should be used.
*         Where path crosses curb, a curb cut or temporary ramp should be used.
*         Ramps can't be steep. For every 1 inch high, a ramp must be at least 12 inches long.
 
 
Preventing Obstructions for Voters Who are Blind or Have Low Vision
*         People who are blind can easily run into objects that hang from above (ex. tree limbs), are open beneath (ex. staircases), or protrude from the side (ex. trophy cases).
 
Solution: Place a barrier within 27 inches of the floor so cane can detect the obstruction.
 

 
Entrance to Polling Place and Voting Area
*         Doorways must be at least 32 inches wide.
*         Threshold must not be more than 3/4 inches high at door and must be beveled on each side.
*         No heavy doors.
*         No slick, round door handles.
 
Solutions: If door is too heavy to open easily, adjust door closer, disconnect operating arm, or prop door open on Election Day. If smooth round handles are on door, use temporary hardware or prop door open. If threshold is two high, use temporary threshold ramp on each side that is too high.
 
 
Voting Area
*         An accessible voting machine on wheelchair accessible booth should be located along an accessible path in a location that ensures privacy.
