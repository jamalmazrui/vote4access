The States that are required to accept the national form will accept copies of the application printed from the computer image on regular paper stock, signed by the applicant, and mailed in an envelope with the correct postage.
First Time Voters Who Register by Mail If you are registering to vote for the first time in your jurisdiction and are mailing this registration application, Federal law requires you to show proof of identification the first time you vote. Proof of identification includes:
•             A current and valid photo identification or
•             A current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or government document that shows your name and address.
Voters may be exempt from this requirement if they submit a COPY of this identification with their mail in voter registration form. If you wish to submit a COPY, please keep the following in mind:
•             Your state may have additional identification requirements which may mandate you show identification at the polling place even if you meet the Federal proof of identification.
•             Do not submit original documents with this 
application, only COPIES.

If you want to register with a party, print in the box the full name of the party of your choice.
If you do not want to register with a party, write "no party" or leave the box blank. Do not write in the word "independent" if you mean "no party," because this might be confused with the name of a political party in your State.
