<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>All these analyses show
that people with disabilities face particular challenges in voting and voter
registration. These challenges explain in large part the gap between voting by people
with and without disabilities. The barriers range from physical accessibility
limitations, such as a lack of accessible parking and ramps to voting machines
that are difficult to use to a lack of poll worker training. The white paper
concludes with recommendations to the Federal Government and to States to
improve accessibility in subsequent elections.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES: Observations on Polling
Place Accessibility and Related Federal Guidance</span></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> – US Government Accountability Office</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Request for the Report</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Government
Accountability Office (GAO) Report was prepared in response to a request by
Senator Charles Schumer, Senate Minority Leader; Senator Roy Blunt, Chairman of
the HHS Appropriations Subcommittee; and Senator Robert Casey, Ranking Member
of the Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families, for a report on
accessibility of polling places in the 2016 election for persons with
disabilities. GAO had completed similar reports for the 2000 and 2008 general
elections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The GAO Review</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>GAO reviewed a sample of
178 polling places including 45 early in-person voting places in 11 counties
and 6 states as well as the District of Columbia, and 133 election day polling
places in 21 counties in 12 states and the District of Columbia. The review
included an analysis of features and activities both inside and outside the
polling place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>GAO sent teams of two GAO
staff to each county in the study during early in-person voting from October
26, 2016, through November 2, 2016, and separately on Election Day, November 8,
2016. In addition, to determine the steps that states took to facilitate voting
by people with disabilities, GAO administered a web-based survey to state
election officials and the District of Columbia from January 2017 to May 2017.
GAO staff also interviewed state election administration experts, officials at
Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and
other state and local officials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Legal Requirements</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Authority to regulate
elections is shared by federal, state, and local officials in the United
States. The primary responsibility for the administration of federal and state
elections rests with the individual states, typically the Secretary of State,
and with local officials at the county or city level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that people with disabilities have equal
access to public services and programs. Although the ADA itself does not
address voting places specifically, the implementing regulations and Department
of Justice (DOJ) guidelines address voting accessibility. Additionally, the
Help America Vote Act (HAVA) required that by January 1, 2006, each polling
place have at least one voting system that is accessible by people with
disabilities. HAVA also established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to
serve as a clearinghouse and information source for election officials who
administer federal elections. Both the ADA and HAVA create clear legal
requirements for polling place accessibility. The challenge is to fully implement
these requirements and to ensure that election officials, particularly those at
the state and local level, are aware of these requirements and commit adequate
resources to train and support polling place workers to ensure accessibility
for voters with disabilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Findings</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>During the 2016 general
election, approximately 137 million people voted. About 51 million people voted
before Election Day. Since 2000, the number of people voting before Election
Day has steadily increased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>GAO found that 60% of the
sampled voting places had one or more potential impediments. The most common
impediments were to physical access outside of polling places, such as steep
ramps, lack of signage indicating accessible routes, and poor parking or path
surfaces. Of the 178 polling places sampled, 89, or 65%, had a voting station
with an “accessible” voting system that could still impede casting a ballot.
For example, some voting stations were not set up to accommodate people who use
wheelchairs. Additionally, GAO found some variation in the extent to which
accessible voting systems are provided for early in-person voting. GAO found
one county without accessible voting systems at five of its early-voting
locations. Four states reported to GAO that accessible voting systems are not
required for in-person voting before Election Day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Most states that completed
GAO’s survey reported taking actions during the 2016 election to facilitate
voting access for people with disabilities. 44 states reported having accessibility
standards and 48 states reported at least one oversight activity. These results
are encouraging. However, in many cases, the standards codified in state law
are antiquated, and it is unclear if election officials are following state law
or federal law as their primary guidelines when oversee elections. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In Part V of this white
paper, we include recommendations based on these findings.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'> – Self Advocates Becoming Empowered</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Since 2000, Self Advocates
Becoming Empowered (SABE) has provided training and technical assistance to
increase the number of voters with disabilities. Following the 2014 and 2016
elections, SABE administered a “voter experience survey” to investigate issues
surrounding voting for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities
(“I/DD”). The purpose of the survey was to increase the number of voters with
I/DD and provide technical assistance to improve their voting experiences. The
essential question asked in the SABE survey was <i>why </i>people with I/DD are
not voting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Voters with I/DD still
rely heavily on others to get to the polls. In 2016, forty percent (40%) of
voters got to the polls using friends, family, service providers, or public
transportation. Only twenty-five percent (25%) of voters used their personal
vehicles to get to the polls. Nine percent (9%) of voters walked or used their
wheelchair. Additionally, twenty-two percent (22%) of voters used “other”
means, like absentee mail-in ballots, to cast their votes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Over two thirds (66%) of
voters indicated they did not have physical accessibility issues at the polls.
However, twenty-two percent (22%) of voters noted issues of physical
accessibility, including problems with accessible parking, inability to locate
the entrance or voting area, ramps or elevators being broken or difficult to
use, or not enough space for wheelchairs in voting areas. Seventeen percent
(17%) had “other” issues, likely related to absentee voting. Some voters
experienced multiple barriers to voting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>While at the polls,
thirty-six percent (36%) of voters with I/DD required assistance from friends,
family, service providers, or poll workers to cast their vote. Sixty percent
(60%) were able to vote independently and four (4%) used “some other way” to
vote. This is a two percent (2%) decrease in the ability of individuals with
I/DD to vote independently between the 2014 and 2016 election.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Poll workers continue to
have the most direct effect on the experiences of voters with I/DD. One of
every four voters with I/DD did not have a positive experience with a poll
worker. Additionally, there was a dramatic decrease in the level of respect
voters with I/DD felt from poll workers between 2014, at ninety-six percent
(96%), compared to only forty-seven (47%) in 2016.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the 2016 election, one
out of ten voters with I/DD wanted to use an accessible voting machine,
however, only one third reported poll workers offered an accessible voting
machine for their use. Nearly half, forty-eight percent (48%), were not asked
if they wanted to use an accessible machine at all. Seventeen percent (17%) of
voters stated poll workers did not know how to operate accessible equipment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The most dramatic change
between the 2014 and 2016 elections are the methods in which individuals with
I/DD chose to vote. In 2014, seventy-five percent (75%) of voters indicated
they voted at the polling place, compared to only forty-three percent (43%) in
2016. The number of early voters doubled as well, with only ten percent (10%)
in 2014, compared to twenty-seven percent (27%) in 2016. Similarly, the use of
absentee mail-in ballots doubled between 2014, at fifteen percent (15%), and
2016, at thirty percent (30%).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Many voters with I/DD
indicated they are interested in alternative forms of voting. When asked what
method would be easiest to use to vote, thirty-three percent (33%) responded
that using a tablet or computer would be easiest for them. Thirty-one percent (31%)
stated absentee mail-in ballots would be easiest method for them to vote.
Absentee ballots are available in some version in all 50 states with 20 states
needing an “excuse” to vote absentee ballot. Only three states – Oregon,
Washington and Colorado – use all mail-in ballots for their elections.
California anticipates implementing all mail-in ballots in the 2018 elections.
Others states adopting this practice include Arizona, Hawaii, Nebraska, New
Jersey, and Utah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the 2016 election,
eighty-six percent (86%) of voters with I/DD felt good about their voting
experience. This is a dramatic decrease from 2014, when ninety-nine percent
(99%) of voters indicated the same. When asked what could have made their
voting experience better, eighteen percent (18%) of voters indicated they did
not feel prepared to vote on candidates and issues. Fourteen percent (14%) of
new voters indicated they had problems reading and understanding the ballots.
Twelve percent (12%) stated more equipment availability and accessibility would
increase their voting experience. Ten percent (10%) noted improvements in
physical accessibility and four percent (4%) indicated voter privacy and
signage would improve their experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When asked if voters knew
whom to call if they experienced issues with voting, forty-three percent (43%)
stated they did not. One in five voters with I/DD stated they had not studied
the candidates or issues before voting. The most popular way to obtain
information regarding issues and candidates was through family, friends, and
service provider staff, followed by the internet, talk shows, and candidate
debates.</span></p>

<h3>Turnout and Other Demographics</h3>

<h3>Turnout and Voting Process</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Among voters with
disabilities in 2016, only 53% voted at their polling place on Election Day compared
to 61% of voters without disabilities. Voters with disabilities were more
likely to vote by mail (28%) compared to persons without disabilities (19%).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Selected State Comparisons</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Some states had
particularly significant voter turnout gaps between persons with disabilities
and persons without disabilities. The average gap was 6.3 percentage points.
The states with a gap of 10% or more are shown below.</span></p>

<h3>Why People Did Not Register</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are significant
differences between the responses of people with disabilities and people
without disabilities to a question about why they did not register to vote. Of
persons with disabilities, 45.3% responded that they were not interested in the
election or not involved in politics, compared to 36.1% of persons without
disabilities. Unsurprisingly, there was a large gap between people with
disabilities (22.6%) and people without disabilities (1.6%) who said they did
not register to vote because of a permanent illness or disability.</span></p>

<h2><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Part IV. Impact of Voter ID
Laws</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Thirty-four states now
have some sort of voter identification law, based on a count by the </span><a
href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>National Conference of State Legislators</span></a><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>. The states that require a photo ID are now up to
seven; almost double the number in the 2012 election. Identification
requirements by state can include a wide range of IDs. While some states have
strict Government-issued photo ID requirements, others accept hunting or
fishing licenses, utility bills, passports, birth certificates, paychecks, and
bank statements with the voter’s correct address. If an individual is unable to
provide a permissible ID as defined by their state, their vote is thrown out.
Of the fourteen states with a voter turnout gap greater than ten percent, ten
of these states have enacted some form of Voter ID legislation. </span><a
href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The National Association of State Legislatures outlines
the voter ID requirements in each state</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are a number of
barriers to voting by persons with disabilities that have been created by Voter
ID laws. These include:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Lack of Photo Identification</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a
href="http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/d/download_file_39242.pdf"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>More than 21 million Americans do not have
Government-issued photo IDs</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. This is
especially true among the disability community where many individuals do not
have drivers’ licenses and use a special state-issued ID that may not meet the
requirements of Voter ID laws. In order to obtain a government-issued ID, an
individual must take affirmative steps to acquire one, including collecting
their records, physically visiting their local government office, and reporting
to their state election authority when they move. Moreover, people with
disabilities are often required to move more frequently, especially during
emergencies or because of the circumstances associated with receiving health
care. Therefore, the lack of consistency in their addresses can create
additional challenges for receiving a vote ID.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In addition to these
problems, service providers for people with disabilities are often not provided
with the resources necessary to ensure each of their clients has the
documentation necessary to obtain a government-issued ID. In turn, individuals
with disabilities are unable to vote if their state has enacted some kind of
Voter ID law. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Expense of Obtaining Identification</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Even though many states
now offer free government IDs, prospective voters are still required to incur
significant expenses to obtain one. The background documents required to obtain
the ID cost money and time. In order to get an ID, many states require proof of
identity, proof of legal U.S. residency, and proof of a social security number.

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>After collecting all
relevant documentation as required by the state, an individual is then required
to apply in person to obtain an ID. The travel required is especially a burden
for voters with disabilities, the elderly, and persons in rural areas without
access to public transportation. Moreover, some state counties do not have a
place that can provide a government ID and people are required to travel great
distances in order to obtain one.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We strongly recommend that all 50
states make a concerted effort to analyze accessibility limitations at their
polling places, both on Election Day and for in-person early voting. Furthermore,
we recommend that each state, through their Secretary of State or other
appropriate official, provide guidance to all polling place officials well in
advance of the 2018 election cycle and future elections.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Department of Justice (DOJ)
guidance on accessibility of polling places does not clearly specify the extent
to which federal accessibility requirements are applicable to in-person voting.
Since that is an increasingly important approach to voting for all persons, it
is important for DOJ to provide specific guidance in that area. In particular,
DOJ should make clear that accessibility requirements apply to early in-person
voting.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The SABE report demonstrates there
are still significant barriers to voting access for individuals with I/DD.
Physical accessibility remains a concern, particularly getting into a polling
location and the reliability of voting machines. In regards to poll workers,
SABE suggests training poll workers on disability etiquette and ways to meet
the needs of voters with I/DD. Including individuals with I/DD in training sessions
was also noted as beneficial. </span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Given the dramatic increase in the
use of alternative methods of voting, we agree with SABE’s suggestion that Secretary
of State Offices and Election Officials work with individuals with I/DD to
improve absentee mail-in ballots, including electronic remote ballot marking
that allows a disabled voter to reach and mark their ballot privately and
independently. Individuals with I/DD should be included in this discussion to
ensure these methods are accessible. This discussion should also include a
review of electronic ballot marking tools, which could help voters with
disabilities cast their ballot.</span></p>

</span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>States should ensure that their voting
laws are consistent with federal law with regard to accessibility, especially
for elections that are not under federal jurisdiction. States should also
provide their election officials better guidelines for ensuring accessibility.</span></p>
