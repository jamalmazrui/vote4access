National Disability Voter Registration Week
July 15-19, 2019
Social Media Toolkit
 
The REV UP Campaign is coordinating National Disability Voter Registration Week (NDVRW) during the week of July 15-19, 2019 to make a concerted effort to get people with disabilities registered to vote, educated about this year's election, and prepared to cast a ballot in November. With numerous events and activities happening around the country during this time, we also hope to garner attention from media and candidates running for office. Moving forward, we plan to hold NDVRW annually in the third week of July, just before the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
 
The REV UP Campaign, launched by the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) in 2016, is a nonpartisan initiative that coordinates with national, state, and local disability organizations to increase the political power of the disability community while also engaging candidates and the media on disability issues. The Campaign focuses on voter registration, education, access, and engagement. REV UP stands for Register! Educate! Vote! Use your Power!
 
Use this Social Media Toolkit to help us spread the word about NDVRW! For additional resources on organizing voter registration events and other ways to participate in NDVRW, please download the full NDVRW Toolkit.

Press Release Template
The press release template linked below is open for REV UP partners to use and modify as they see fit to promote their involvement with National Disability Voter Registration Week this year.
●       Press Release Template - REV UP National Disability Voter Registration Week 2019
 
Some considerations for your press release:
●       Please use "National Disability Voter Registration Week" and mention the REV UP Campaign in your release. This helps us build brand awareness around NDVRW and identifies the REV UP Campaign as a national effort to increase the political power and participation of people with disabilities.
●       Clearly indicate the details about your voter registration events (date, time, location, and organizer contact information).
●       Send the release to state and local media in advance of your event.
 
Request a Proclamation
A great way to raise awareness about NDVRW is to advocate for your state, city, town, etc. to recognize it. You can reach out to your Governor, Mayor, City Council, County Commissioner, State Representative, etc. to request that they issue a proclamation declaring the week in question National Disability Voter Registration Week (a draft Proclamation is available here). This is a great way to develop or leverage a relationship with your local and state government. Please send any Proclamations you get to programs@aapd.com so we can show the influence and support of REV UP across the country!
 
Submit Information About Your NDVRW Event
If your organization, city, or state is putting together an event for National Disability Voter Registration Week or REV UP, then please submit information about the event onto our website https://aapd.kindful.com/register/rev-up-events. Any information will be added to the State Resources and Events page on AAPD's website.
