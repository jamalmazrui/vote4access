Dear Disability Rights Advocates: 
In July 2015 we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
We can take great pride in the historic advances we have made in the community integration of people with disabilities of all ages since the passage of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. No matter what the issue - education, housing, transportation, personal assistance services, employment, recreation, adaptive technology, durable medical equipment, or health care, we can see the advances that have improved our lives and moved us closer to true equality. 
This has come about by working together and implementing a strategy that has included legislative, legal, direct action, and educational tactics. These tactics are part of our overall goal to bring about the community integration promised in the ADA. 
We cannot rest on our past victories. We must build on the past and move forward using the power we have acquired. This power can be exerted if we Make the DISABILITY VOTE Count! Policymakers are influenced by large numbers of people turning out to vote in the primaries and the general elections. This reality is why we started the REV UP Campaign. 
The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) is a convener, connector, and catalyst for change, increasing the political and economic power of people with disabilities. The focus of the REV UP Campaign is to get more people with disabilities and our supporters registered and voting! 
This Toolkit is designed to help you begin organizing in your state. Effective REV UP Campaigns will convene state and local disability organizations, such as centers for independent living (CIL) and protection and advocacy (P&A) organizations, to amplify this message and reach more people with disabilities.  
If you need assistance getting connected to CILs or P&As in your state please contact AAPD at communications@aapd.com. We'll be happy to make an introduction. 
 
 
Register! Educate! Vote! 
Use your Power! 
             
 
 
South Dakotans with disabilities CAN influence the outcome  of the June 7th South Dakota Primary and the November 8th General Election 
 
 
More than any time in memory: 
> Elected leaders and political candidates are recognizing the 57 MILLION Americans with disabilities-from birth to advanced age-as a powerful, important constituency. 
> Issues important to people with disabilities must be part of the platform for any candidate running for public office. 
 
Join thousands of Americans with disabilities in this important and historic effort! 
 
Don't Mourn...Organize, Register, and VOTE! 
Onward to November 8, 2016! Make the DISABILITY VOTE Count!

"Vote as if your life depends on it - because it does!" 
Justin Dart, Jr., Texan, patriot, father of the ADA. 
 
 
The November 8th election will be one of the most important elections in over a decade. 
The disability community-people with disabilities, family members, attendants, providers, professionals, advocates and supporters-has a major stake in the outcome of this election. 
  
The Disability Vote can make a difference on issues such as: 
•      Adequate funding and coverage for Medicaid acute and long term services and supports. 
•      Waiting lists for home and community services. 
•      Consolidation and closure of public institutions. 
•      Integrated employment at no less than minimum wage. 
•      Accessible, affordable, integrated housing. 
•      Adequate funding for quality public and higher education. 
•      Quality Medicaid managed care with strict accountability measures. 
•      Recruitment and retention strategies for improved wages and benefits for community attendants. 
•      Implementation and enforcement of the "most integrated setting" requirements in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

A Basic Guide to Polling Place Accessibility 
 
This is a basic guide to accessibility to assist in identifying barriers and potential solutions to ensure access to voters with disabilities. Election officials should try to select fully accessible polling places and conduct the full Department of Justice accessibility survey. 
 
 
Parking and Drop-Off Areas 
•      If parking is provided, at least one accessible parking spot that is nearest to the accessible entrance must be provided for every 25 regular parking spaces. 
•      The first accessible spot should be van accessible with an access aisle at least 8ft wide. 
•      Accessible parking spots should be relatively level and not have loose gravel or dirt. 
•      If drop-off area is provided, it should be level and have an access aisle that is at least 5ft deep and 20ft long where people can access entrance (near ramp if necessary). 
 
Solutions: Traffic cones can be used to mark accessible parking spaces and access aisles. Heavy duty mats can be used to level out uneven surfaces. 
 
 
Paths of Travel 
•      There must be an accessible path from parking spot to entrance and voting area. 
•      Path must be at least 36 inches wide and free of steps or level changes more than 1/2 inch. 
•      If accessible path crosses traffic, a marked crosswalk should be used. 
•      Where path crosses curb, a curb cut or temporary ramp should be used. 
•      Ramps can't be steep. For every 1 inch high, a ramp must be at least 12 inches long. 
 
 
Preventing Obstructions for Voters Who are Blind or Have Low Vision 
•      People who are blind can easily run into objects that hang from above (ex. tree limbs), are open beneath (ex. staircases), or protrude from the side (ex. trophy cases). 
 
Solution: Place a barrier within 27 inches of the floor so cane can detect the obstruction. 
 
             
 
Entrance to Polling Place and Voting Area 
•      Doorways must be at least 32 inches wide. 
•      Threshold must not be more than 3/4 inches high at door and must be beveled on each side. 
•      No heavy doors. 
•      No slick, round door handles. 
 
Solutions: If door is too heavy to open easily, adjust door closer, disconnect operating arm, or prop door open on Election Day. If smooth round handles are on door, use temporary hardware or prop door open. If threshold is too high, use temporary threshold ramp on each side that is too high. 
 
 
Voting Area 
•      An accessible voting machine on wheelchair accessible booth should be located along an accessible path in a location that ensures privacy.
