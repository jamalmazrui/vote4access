<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>NCD wishes to express its strong
support for reauthorizing the provisions of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) set to
expire in 2007. NCD is an independent federal agency charged with making
recommendations to the President and Congress to enhance the quality of life
for all Americans with disabilities and their families. NCD’s overall purpose
is to promote policies and practices that guarantee equal opportunity for all
individuals with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the
disability; and to empower individuals with disabilities to achieve economic
selfsufficiency, independent living, and integration into all aspects of
society. NCD is required by its authorizing statute to advise the
Administration and Congress regarding laws and issues that affect people with
disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>NCD is aware of the April 27,
2006, hearing on Renewing the Temporary Provisions of the VRA in the Senate
Judiciary Committee. The foundation of our democratic form of government is the
right to vote. Voting is the most important tool Americans have to influence
the policies the government adopts that affect every aspect of our lives—from
tax policy, to preserving our environment, to protecting equal opportunity in
housing and employment. To ensure that all Americans have this important tool,
we must make sure that every American has an equal opportunity to cast an
effective ballot. Unfortunately, even today, many eligible voters continue to
face barriers that inhibit the exercise of this basic right. It is under these
circumstances that NCD emphasizes the need for the reauthorization of the VRA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For nearly a decade, NCD has made specific recommendations
and published information with respect to aspects of citizens’ voting rights,
including election practices and their impacts on people with disabilities.
NCD’s findings address voting systems, voter registration, polling place
access, poll worker training, and other factors aligned with the current need
for reauthorization of the VRA. NCD’s 1997 publication, <i>National</i> <i>Disability
Policy: A Progress Report</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>(<u><span style='color:blue'>http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/1997/policy.htm</span></u>),
called for new voting systems to be made accessible to all people with
disabilities. In its 1999 report, <i>Implementation of the</i></p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>National Voter Registration Act by State
Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'>(<u><span style='color:blue'>http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/1999/voter.htm</span></u>),
NCD reported that 75 percent of people with disabilities who received services
from state vocational rehabilitation agencies were never asked to register to
vote, as the law requires. A 2000 Harris poll indicated that 42 percent of this
group still was not offered the opportunity to register. NCD’s August 2, 2005,
paper, <i>Enjoyment of the Right to Participation in Political and Public Life
by Persons with Disabilities:</i></p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Illustrations of Implementation from the United
States</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>(<u><span style='color:blue'>http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2005/enjoyment.htm</span></u>),
provides examples of voting accessibility that work in favor of disenfranchised
people. The paper discusses the need to prioritize accessibility by including
training for poll workers and election officials to ensure that they understand
how to make appropriate accommodations for voters with disabilities, a
population comprised in part of seniors, people from diverse racial and ethnic
groups, and people with alternative language needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>NCD made four key recommendations
in its 2001 paper, <i>Inclusive Federal Election Reform </i>(http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2001/electionreform.htm),
that remain relevant to current deliberations surrounding reauthorization of
the VRA: (1) The President and Congress must enact federal legislation that
incorporates the use of modern technological concepts and systems capable of
ensuring full participation by all citizens; (2) The President and Congress
must address complex issues and concerns surrounding existing federal
legislation [such as the VRA] and effective ways to improve those laws through
amendments or regulatory action while maintaining current rights and
protections; (3) Bipartisan national, state, and local voter registration and
get-out-the-vote initiatives are encouraged for people with disabilities and
other disenfranchised Americans; and (4) The President and Congress must
contact key citizens from disenfranchised groups and include them on any
commission or similarly named body to investigate the status of the full range
of voting accessibility issues in America.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The VRA is still needed to ensure
that all citizens, including people with disabilities, as well as seniors,
people within the lower socioeconomic levels, people from diverse racial and
ethnic groups and people with language needs, are provided an equal opportunity
to participate in the political process. The existing VRA paved the way for
more Americans to vote and set the stage for initial dialogue that resulted in
the enactment of supplementary laws addressing the enfranchisement of people
with disabilities. Since the VRA’s enactment, the rise in voter registration
has brought to the forefront a number of needs that should be considered at
reauthorization, such as accessibility enforcement components and the
coordination of new technologies, including universal design. In collaboration
with other pertinent laws, reauthorization of the VRA can boost full
participation in the political process by all citizens.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>NCD urges our nation’s leaders to
respond in a timely manner to these recommendations in order to ensure full
participation in the democratic processes. Full participation by all eligible
citizens allows our society to harness the knowledge and resources of the
community as a whole. Inclusion strengthens and enlivens America’s political
and public life, and our society at-large will be the ultimate beneficiary.</p>
