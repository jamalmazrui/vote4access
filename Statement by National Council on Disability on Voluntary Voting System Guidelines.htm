line-height:107%'><b><u>National Council on Disability Statement: Voluntary
Voting System Guidelines</u> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:13.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Consistent with its legislative mandate as an independent
federal agency, the National Council on Disability (NCD) provides advice to the
President and Congress by making recommendations on how to enhance the quality
of life for all Americans with disabilities and their families.  In <i>Inclusive
Federal Election Reform</i>,<sup>1</sup> NCD made recommendations to Congress
and the President on how to improve the accessibility of voting systems.  This
NCD statement shows alignment of those recommendations with the current efforts
of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), established through the Help
America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002, to establish guidelines for accessible voting
systems.  As more fully described below, NCD calls on the EAC to make voting
systems more accessible to people with disabilities by requiring privacy
protections for paper ballots, comprehensible audio for electronic voting
machines, and paper ballots that are accessible to voters with poor vision. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Dual Roles of HAVA: Promote Access and Enhance Integrity
</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:1.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In 2002, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA),
which guarantees by law the opportunity for people with disabilities to
privately and independently cast an accurate and secure ballot in every polling
station throughout the country.<sup>2</sup>  While HAVA implementation
continues to be a “work in progress,” it has already had a positive impact on
voters with disabilities.  For example, accessible electronic voting equipment
allowed a Montana voter, who is blind, to vote without assistance and in privacy
for the first time in almost 30 years.  That same voter told a reporter,
“[Accessible voting equipment] is like manna from heaven… But it's going to
come to a point where that's what we just learn to expect. When that day comes,
being blind will be a whole lot easier.”<sup>3</sup>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>To help fulfill HAVA’s mandate to provide accessible voting
with enhanced voting system integrity, Congress created the Election Assistance
Commission (EAC), the Election Assistance Standards Board, the Election
Assistance Commission Board of Advisors, and the Technical Guidelines
Development Committee. Congress authorized the EAC to disburse $3.9 billion to
the states to replace old voting equipment and to adopt other election reform
measures.<sup>4</sup> To help states that receive these funds comply with HAVA,
one of the EAC’s functions is to establish voluntary guidelines for voting
equipment and to provide technical guidance to the states on implementing
election technologies. With the help of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), the EAC produced Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG)
to help states comply with HAVA. The VVSG provides technical specifications for
HAVA-compliant voting systems. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>History of the Voluntary Voting System
Guidelines </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The EAC submitted the first draft of the VVSG<sup>5</sup>
for public comment in early 2005 and promised that the EAC would improve the
guidelines based on the feedback about accessibility issues.  The EAC received
considerable feedback to its first draft version. In addition to concerned
individual voters who responded to the EAC’s call for suggestions,
organizations such as the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>American Council of the Blind (ACB), the Consortium for
Citizens with Disabilities (CCD), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:15.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), and others offered
numerous suggestions for modification. Many of the changes adopted in the final
version of the VVSG are aligned with NCD’s 2001 <i>Inclusive Federal Election
Reform</i> report, and are the result of dialogue with the disability
community. The EAC often adopted word-for-word the language suggested by
various advocacy groups.<sup>6</sup>   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:15.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Perhaps the most critical category of changes to the VVSG
was the adoption of “shall” language rather than “should” language for many of
the voting system features.  The VVSG states that a “should” statement is
equivalent to a suggested feature, whereas a “shall” statement indicates a
mandatory feature.  CCD observed in its letter to the EAC: “HAVA funds are
provided for a onetime purchase… [“should”] requirements will have little
impact on what is available to consumers for years to come… a guideline or
standard with a “should” is not part of what is required to meet the legal
requirement and will have little impact on the market buying decisions.”<sup>7</sup> 
At the suggestion of many disability advocates, the EAC changed much of the
“should” language that made a feature only a “suggestion” or “recommendation”
for a state to the stronger “shall” language, which denotes a requirement.<sup>8</sup>
NCD concurs with the changes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In December of 2005, the EAC officially adopted the VVSG
and effective December 2007, voting systems will be tested against the VVSG.<b><sup>9</sup></b>
The EAC anticipates further modifications to the VVSG prior to the 2008
election. The EAC should continue to recognize voters with disabilities as key
stakeholders when making further modifications to the VVSG. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In November of 2005, NCD issued a paper entitled <i>Enjoyment
of the Right to Participation in </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:13.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><i>Political and Public Life by Persons with Disabilities -

praised the EAC for providing informational resources to states that
highlighted accessibility for people with disabilities. NCD commends the EAC
for its work on the VVSG since 2005 and for responding to feedback from NCD and
advocacy groups for disenfranchised citizens, including people with
disabilities.<b> </b></p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Recommendations for Improving the VVSG and HAVA
Implementation </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Despite recognizable improvements in the latest version of
the VVSG, the EAC failed to address some of the concerns previously expressed
by the disability community.  NCD reiterates the suggested improvements as
follows:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
103%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Privacy</b>: When a voter uses an alternate ballot with
accessible features to cast an electronic vote, the VVSG requires voting
systems to protect the privacy of that voter by not displaying information that
would indicate the voter used an alternate voting format.<sup>11</sup> However,
the VVSG does not require privacy protections for accessible paper ballots. 
Yet the VVSG requires the privacy of both paper <u>and</u> electronic ballots
when the voter uses alternate language features.<sup>12</sup> The VVSG needs a
parallel privacy requirement for paper ballots cast in an alternate accessible
format. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
103%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Audio</b>: The VVSG does not require that audio be “readily
comprehensible” or that candidate names be correctly pronounced.<sup>13</sup>
Voters with visual impairments often are accustomed to only hearing candidate
names and these voters need voting machines with intelligible speech.  Voting
systems that provide digitized human speech are preferable to systems with
synthesized speech because digitized speech is “more readily </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:36.5pt'>comprehensible” and more likely to contain the correct
pronunciation of candidate names.  “Shall” language would convey the necessity
for “readily comprehensible speech” and for normal pronunciation of candidate
names. </p>

</span></span><b>Accessible Paper Ballots</b>: The VVSG fails to ensure
accessibility for voters with the full range of visual impairments.<sup>14</sup> 
Voting systems that use paper ballots need to make provisions for voters with
poor reading vision<span style='font-size:8.5pt;line-height:103%'>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.5pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Finally, we encourage the EAC to use NCD's work as a
reference point and as a basis for further examination of voting issues that
impact the lives of citizens, including people with disabilities.  NCD stands
ready to work with the EAC, Administration, Congress and the public to ensure that
public policy is shaped so it will provide the greatest possible opportunities
for all Americans to have an equal opportunity as they strive to be fully
productive, contributing citizens. </p>
