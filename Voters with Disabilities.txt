Voters with Disabilities 

July 2016, Pub. #5412.01 

More than 35 million Americans with disabilities are eligible to vote. But only 15 million do vote. That means 20 million people with disabilities are not voting. Their votes could have a big impact on who is elected and on policies that affect people with disabilities. Some elections are very close. Every vote counts. 
Your vote decides who will be in office. Voting is your chance to tell elected officials what issues and projects matter to you. Your vote counts! Your vote is important!

Federal and State Laws that Protect Voters with Disabilities 
You have the right to vote in an accessible place. You also have the right to a secret and easy-to-use way to vote. Federal laws and California laws protect your right to vote. 
Federal Laws 
The federal laws that protect voters with disabilities are: 
Help America Vote Act (HAVA) 
HAVA, the Help America Vote Act of 2002, sets the rules for voting systems in federal elections. These rules include making sure voting systems are accessible for voters with disabilities. Accessible means that the voting system is easy to use privately  and independently. 
HAVA says: 
-      By January 1, 2006, every precinct must have at least one voting machine or system that is accessible to voters with disabilities. This includes blind and low vision voters. 
-      Each voter must be able to vote secretly and by him/herself. 
-      State and local governments can get grant money to help make polling  places accessible.  
-      Elections officials and poll workers will be trained to help voters with disabilities. 
42 USC § 15301, et seq. 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 
The ADA is a law that says employers, state and local governments, and public places cannot discriminate against you because of your disability. 
You must be able to register and vote. Your county must have polling places that are accessible to you. Accessible polling places means the parking, paths to the polling place, entrances, exits and voting areas are easy for you to use. 
42 USC § 12101, et seq. 
National Voter Registration Act (NVRA or "Motor Voter Act") of 1993 The NVRA makes it easier for you to register to vote because you can register at: 
-      Any state office that provides public assistance  
-      Any state-funded program that serves people with disabilities 
These agencies all have voter registration forms. And they can help you fill them out and mail them. 
42 USC § 1973 (gg), et seq. 
Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEHA) of 1984 
The VAEHA says that polling places for federal elections must be accessible to you. 
States must help you register and vote. You must be able to get information by TDD/TTY. If no accessible polling place is available, you must be given another way to vote. 
42 USC § 1973 (ee), et seq. 
Federal Standards for Electronic Voting Systems 
In 2002, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) said all voting systems must be accessible to voters with disabilities.  
To learn more about these standards, see: www.fec.gov 
California State Laws 
The state laws that protect voters with disabilities are: 
The California Constitution 
The California Constitution says voting must be done in secret.  
California Constitution, Art. II § 7 
Accessible Voting Technology Act (AVTA) of 2002 
The AVTA says blind and low-vision voters have the right to vote without being "helped". 
The law says you must:  
-      Be able to use, choose, and move data and work the controls of the voting system. 
-      Have the same access to voting and technology as voters who are not blind or low-vision.  
-      Have access to at least 1 accessible voting unit at your polling place. 
California Elections Code § 19225, et seq. 
Proposition 41  
Proposition 41 was passed by the voters in 2002. It says that counties can get some money ("matching funds") from the state when they buy new voting systems. Proposition 41 also sets up the Voting Modernization Board. 
California Elections Code § 19230, et seq. 
Register to Vote 
Who can vote? 
You can register to vote if you are: 
-      A U.S. citizen, 
-      A California resident, 
-      At least 18 years old, 
-      Not in prison or on parole for a felony conviction, and 
-      Not found by a court to be "Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity," "Incompetent to Stand Trial," a "Mentally Disordered Sex Offender," or a "Mentally Disordered Prisoner."  In addition, some other individuals on conservatorship may not be eligible if a court finds that the person cannot express a desire to participate in the voting process and the court specifically takes away the right to vote in the conservatorship papers.   
How to register 
If you meet these requirements, you can get a voter registration form and fill it out. Return it to your County Elections Office or the Secretary of State. You can mail it for free. 
You must put these items on the registration form: 
-      Your name. 
-      A mailing address. If you are homeless, put an address where you can get mail. This address could be the post office, a friend or relative's home, a homeless shelter or social service agency.  
-      A residence address. This information is needed to assign your polling place (where you vote). You can put a street intersection if you are homeless. 
-      A California driver's license or California ID card number. If you do not have a driver's license or ID, use the last four digits of your Social Security number. - You must sign the form and swear all the information on it is correct. 
You will receive a Voter Notification Card in the mail about 2 weeks after you register. Make sure the information is correct. Let the Elections Office know if something on the card is wrong.

How to Vote 
Where do I vote? 
You vote at your polling place. It is open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. on Election Day. Check your Sample Ballot or the postcard mailed to you saying you registered. This will tell you where to vote. 
Is my polling place accessible? 
Maybe. Look for the blue wheelchair symbol on the back page of your Sample Ballot. If there is a blue wheelchair symbol, then your polling place should be accessible.  
By law, each state must have guidelines about accessible polling places. You can find a checklist for polling places prepared by the U. S. Department of Justice at:  www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/votingck.htm 
The Secretary of State has a Polling Place Accessibility Checklist for California. 
Download the checklist from: http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/additional-elections-information/publications-andresources/polling-place-accessibility-guidelines/polling-place-accessibility-checklist/ or, ask the Secretary of State's Office to mail you a copy: 1-800-345-VOTE (8683) - voice or TDD/TTY    
Accessible polling places have:  
-      Marked accessible parking near the entrance 
-      A clear path from the parking area to the polling place 
-      Doors that are wide and easy to open 
-      Election materials and signs in large print  
-      Poll workers to help you and answer your questions 
If your polling place is not accessible or you cannot get to the polling place, you can: 
-      Vote by Absentee Ballot before the election. 
-      Ask to vote at an accessible polling place near you. 
-      Use "Curbside Voting". If you cannot come into the polling place, a poll worker will bring a ballot to you at the curb or in your car. 
-      Call your County Elections Office or Disability Rights California if you have questions. 
In the Voting Booth 
Even if your polling place is accessible, your voting system may not be. Every polling place must have at least one accessible voting machine.  
You have the right to a secret and easy-to-use way to vote. Most polling places will have these items to help you:  
-      A tabletop voting booth (for wheelchair access) 
-      Braille and large print instructions  
-      A magnifying sheet 
-      Pictures to help explain the voting system 
-      A ballot marker that is easy to use 
Can other people help me vote? 
Yes. You can: 
-      Choose 1 or 2 people to help you in the voting booth. But, you cannot choose your employer or union official. 
-      Ask a poll worker to help you. But, they must not influence you, and they cannot tell anyone how you voted.  
-      Ask a sign language interpreter to help you. You can bring your own interpreter or call the County Elections Office before the election to request an ASL interpreter.  
You can also take your service animal to the polling place and into the voting booth. 

Vote-By-Mail Ballot 
A Vote-By-Mail Ballot lets you vote by mail. But you must apply for a Vote-By-Mail ballot at least 7 days before the next election. Your Sample Ballot pamphlet has an application. Or you can contact your County Elections Office. See page 14.  Mail your Vote-By-Mail ballot or drop it off at the County Elections Office or at any polling place in the county where you are registered to vote.  
If mailed, it must be postmarked on Election Day and arrive no later than three days after the election. If it is late, it cannot be counted. Vote-by-Mail ballots may dropped off in person until 8 p.m. on Election Day 
Do I have to apply for a Vote-By-Mail ballot before every election? 
Yes, unless you apply for Permanent Vote-By-Mail Status. Permanent Status means a Vote-By-Mail ballot will automatically be sent to you before every election. But if you do not vote in an election, you will be taken off the permanent list. To get back on the list, you must apply again.  
To apply for Permanent Status, use the application in your Sample Ballot, or call your County Elections Office.  
What if I lose my Vote-By-Mail ballot or forget to mail it on time? 
If you lose your Vote-By-Mail ballot, you can vote by Provisional Ballot on Election Day at your polling place. Or request a new one on Election Day, by calling the County Elections Office.  
If you did not mail your ballot on time, be sure to fill out all the information on the ballot and the outer envelope. Then, on Election Day you or someone you choose can take it to any polling place in the county where you are registered to vote.  
Common Questions  
Can Disability Rights California help me? 
Yes. HAVA says Disability Rights California must make sure you can exercise your right to vote.  
If you feel discriminated against because of your disability, or if you think any of the voting laws were broken, contact Disability Rights California. For Disability Rights California's contact information, see page 7. 
What is Provisional Voting? 
If the poll worker cannot determine you are properly registered, they will ask you to fill out a "provisional" ballot. Your provisional ballot will be put in a special envelope in the ballot box. Later, the County Elections Office will check your registration and make sure you are eligible to vote. If you are, they will count your vote. 
The poll worker will give you a receipt. You can call the phone number on the receipt to see if your vote was counted. 
What if I am put in the hospital on or just before Election Day? 
You can still vote. Ask for an Emergency Absentee or Hospitalized Voter Ballot. Call the County Elections Office for an application. Then, send someone to the County Elections Office to pick up your absentee ballot. After you vote, they can return the ballot to the polling place.  
What if I make a mistake on my ballot? 
Give your ballot back to the poll worker. They will give you a new one. You can get up to three ballots. But you cannot get a new ballot if you put the ballot in the ballot box. If you have trouble with the voting equipment, ask a poll worker to help you.
