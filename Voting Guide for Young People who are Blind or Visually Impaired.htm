Vote?</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
right of blind Americans to vote is guaranteed by the United States
Constitution. It is a right that many American citizens have demonstrated,
fought, and died for so that present and future generations can continue to
exercise their right to vote. Therefore, every blind or visually impaired
citizen who is of voting age has a responsibility to exercise the right to
vote.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Voting
in any election, local or national, provides blind and visually impaired
citizens with the opportunity to voice their opinion about elected leaders and
policies, and to help shape the future by electing candidates who share their
views. Elected officials make decisions and pass legislation that impact how
Braille is taught in the classroom, the accessibility of technology used in an
educational setting, and funding of rehabilitation training. Consequently,
voting for candidates who share their views on these issues is one of the most
effective ways that blind and visually impaired young people who are eligible
to vote can influence policy and legislation addressing these issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>When
a citizen does not vote, she is giving away her right to influence our
government and, as a result, government by the will of the majority is replaced
with government by the will of the minority. During the presidential elections
of 2008 and 2012, a bare majority of 58 percent and 55 percent, respectively,
of voting age Americans cast ballots. However, during the midterm elections of
2010 and 2014, only 41 percent and 36 percent, respectively, of the voting age
population voted. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A
significant factor in the low voter turnout that has been experienced during elections
in the United States is the very low turnout among voters aged eighteen to
twenty-four. Only forty-four percent of voters in that age group voted in the
presidential election of 2008, and the percentage dropped even lower to
forty-one percent in 2012. For the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014, the
percentage of eighteen to twenty-four year olds who voted was only twenty-three
percent and twenty-one percent, respectively.  It is vital that blind and
visually impaired Americans of voting age exercise their right to vote so that
government by the will of the majority is assured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Prior
to the passage of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) in 2002, voters who were
blind or visually impaired had to rely on sighted assistance to mark their
ballot. HAVA has enabled voters with disabilities to fully exercise the
fundamental right to vote privately and independently by requiring that every
polling place have at least one accessible voting system for all federal
elections. In addition, many states have enacted legislation to require at
least one accessible voting system in each polling place for all state and
local elections.   </span></p>

be obtained from your state, district or local board of elections, libraries,

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Blind and visually
impaired voters may cast their ballot at their local polling place on Election
Day, by voting at an early voting center, or completing an absentee ballot
prior to Election Day. Most of the accessible voting systems in use today at
the polling place or early voting center utilize a touch screen where voters
can view the ballot and make selections. They will also include an audio ballot,
as well as large print and other low vision features to enable blind and
visually impaired voters to vote privately and independently. These systems are
designed to be easy to use, so no need to worry if you are not a techie! </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The speech of the audio
ballot may be either synthesized or a recorded human voice. Headphones are
connected to the voting system so that only the voter can hear the ballot. A
control box with buttons or a telephone style keypad is used by the voter to go
through the ballot contests and make selections, as well as to increase or
decrease the speed and volume of the audio. Instructions at the beginning of
the ballot will tell you what buttons to push to move through the ballot and
make selections. Voters with low vision can enlarge the print displayed on the
touch screen and change the contrast to make the print easier to read. Voters
with low vision make their selections simply by touching the screen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Another type of
accessible voting system in use at polling places today utilizes the telephone.
With this system, the poll worker calls a telephone number, enters a code, and
then hands the phone to the voter. The voter uses the telephone keypad to move
through the audio ballot and make selections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A number of states have
switched from a system based on voting at a local polling place to a vote by
mail system. In a vote by mail system, a paper ballot is mailed to the voter,
who marks the ballot by hand, and then mails it back to the local board of
elections. States who use a vote by mail system must still comply with HAVA and
provide an accessible ballot marking system to blind and visually impaired
voters for all federal elections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Before Election Day
arrives, it is always a good idea to take an opportunity to practice vote,
particularly if you are a first-time or new voter. Invite a representative from
your local board of elections to a meeting of your local NFB chapter, or to
your school to demonstrate the accessible voting machine and allow voters to
practice vote. This way, when Election Day arrives, you will be able to
concentrate on making your selections without being distracted by trying to
figure out how to operate the voting system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Another way that blind
and visually impaired citizens can vote is with an absentee ballot. In general,
state election law permits blind and visually impaired voters to vote in any
election by absentee ballot. However, voting by absentee ballot typically
involves a paper ballot and telling your choices to a sighted assistant who
marks the ballot for you. Consequently, voting by absentee ballot is usually
neither a private nor an independent way to vote for many blind and visually
impaired voters. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Some states are
starting to make online ballot delivery and marking systems available to voters
with disabilities. When designed in accordance with the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA, these systems allow voters with
disabilities to access and mark their ballot using their own computer and
access technology. Once the ballot has been marked, it typically is printed and
mailed to the local board of elections to be counted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If you are voting on Election
Day, you will need to go to the polling place for your election district or
precinct. The location of your polling place will be indicated on your voter
registration card. You may also be able to find your polling place location on
the website of your local or state board of elections. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Once you have arrived
at your polling place, you will need to check in with poll workers by giving
your name and requesting an accessible voting system. If you live in a state
that requires some form of photo identification, you will need to show an
acceptable form of identification to the poll worker who checks you in. Once
you have given your name and shown your identification, be sure to repeat your
request to use an accessible voting system. After your check in process is
complete, a poll worker will show you where the accessible voting system is
located and hand you the headphones and control box. Depending on the type of
machine, you may need to insert a paper ballot. Once the audio ballot has
started, the poll worker should walk away so you can vote in private.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Poll workers have many
responsibilities on Election Day. In addition, the training they receive on the
accessible voting system is frequently insufficient to equip them with the
knowledge they need to set up and operate the system, and to resolve any problems
that may occur. Consequently, it is not uncommon for blind and low vision
voters to encounter poll workers who do not know how to set up or operate the
accessible voting system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If upon your arrival at
the polling place for a federal election poll workers tell you that the
accessible voting system is not available or not working, or if the system
malfunctions while you are voting, it is extremely important that you politely,
but firmly, insist on your right to vote privately and independently. Request
that an accessible system be brought to the polling place, or that a technician
be sent to the polling place to repair the system. If poll workers offer to
assist you in marking a paper ballot, politely decline this offer, and firmly,
but politely, repeat your desire to vote privately and independently using an
accessible system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In many cases when a
voter is patient and politely, but firmly, insists on her right to vote using
an accessible system, poll workers are able to resolve the problem. However, if
poll workers have made every attempt to honor your request, but are unable to
provide an accessible voting system that operates properly, you should still
exercise your right to vote by voting with assistance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:0in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>If you are unable to
vote privately and independently on an accessible voting system at your polling
place during a federal election because there is no accessible system available
or the system is not operating, the most important thing you can do is to file
a HAVA complaint with your state or local board of elections. While HAVA
guarantees the right of blind and visually impaired voters to vote privately
and independently, it does not provide them a means to enforce this right through
private action when it is violated. Therefore, filing a HAVA complaint is the
most effective way blind voters can be sure that problems are brought to the
attention of election officials and the U.S. Department of Justice, which has
authority to enforce HAVA. Because there is no private right of action under
HAVA, it is imperative that blind voters who are not able to vote privately and
independently at their polling place during a federal election file a HAVA
complaint so that the Justice Department has a true picture of the problems
that voters with disabilities are experiencing.</span></p>
