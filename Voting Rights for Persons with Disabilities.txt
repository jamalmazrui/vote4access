Overview of Laws That Protect Voters with Disabilities 
 
            Voting is a fundamental right for all Americans, and there are numerous federal laws that protect the rights of persons with disabilities in the voting process.  The U.S. Supreme Court has stated, ANo right is more precious in a free economy than that of having a voice in the election of those who make laws under which, as good citizens, we must live.  Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined.@  (Westbury v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17 (1964)).  Yet, historically, for a person with a disability, voting has been a difficult and cumbersome process, resulting in persons with disabilities being dissuaded from participating in the electoral process.  
 
            A series of federal laws incrementally increased equal, independent access for voters with disabilities.  Most recently, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), which provides federal funding to the states to ensure equal access for voters with disabilities.  This guide will detail the history of voting rights for persons with disabilities, and describe how to take action to enforce one=s voting rights if those rights have been violated. 
 
           
           
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 
29 U.S.C. '794 
 
(          This federal law states in part, ANo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.@ 
 
(        Voting is considered a >program= or >service= of the County and State. 
 
(          If one feels there has been discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of Section 504, one may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice.  (See Appendix at E).  Such a complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the discrimination.  The Department of Justice may extend the time for filing a complaint for good cause, but you should not expect such an extension. 
 
Voting Rights Act of 1982 
42 U.S.C. '1973aa-6 
 
(          Provision for voters who require assistance to vote by reason of blindness, disability or inability to read or write; 
 
(          Such voters may be given assistance by the person of their choice, except: 
 
(          The voters= employer or agent of their employer, or (             An officer or agent of the voter=s Union. 
 
(          In Arizona, the person assisting may be a minor or the voter=s own choice of election officials (one from each party), but cannot be a candidate for office.  (See A.R.S. 16-580). 
 
Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984 
42 U.S.C. '1973 et seq A.R.S. 16-581 
 
(          Polling places for federal elections must be accessible.  If not accessible, one must be allowed another way of voting; 
 
(          States must assist persons with disabilities to register to vote; 
 
(          Persons with disabilities must be able to access voter information by TDD/TTY.  
 
Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 
42 U.S.C. '12101 et seq 
 
(          Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by state and local governmental entities, and includes non-discrimination in voting as a Aprogram@ or Aservice@ of the state and local governmental entity; 
 
(           Voter registration, polling places and voting must be accessible. 
 
National Voter Registration Act of 1993 
42 U.S.C. '1973 (gg) et seq 
A.R.S. 16-140 
 
(         Commonly known as the AMotor Voter@ Act; 
 
(          Allows one to register to vote at any state office that provides public assistance, or any state funded program that serves persons with disabilities.  (For example, your local DMV or DES office). 
 
Help America Vote Act of 2002 
42 U.S.C. '15301 
A.R.S. 16-441 et seq 
 
(          Title III of HAVA applies only to elections for federal office; 
 
(          Provided federal funds to states to improve election administration and replace outdated and inaccessible voting systems; 
 
(          Created minimum standards that states must follow in election administration; 
 
(          HAVA created a new federal agency to serve as a clearinghouse for election administration, the AElection Assistance Commission@ (EAC).  Each state must file a plan with the EAC describing how it intends to use its HAVA funds to implement voter education, adopt guidelines and performance measures, and conduct ongoing management of the state=s plan.  The EAC has a Standards Board and a Board of Advisors to review voting system guidelines and recommendations, including accessibility. 
 
General Rights         
 
                 (          Polling sites must be physically accessible to persons with disabilities; 
                 (         People have the right to a private and independent vote; 
(          By January 1, 2006, must have at least one voting system that is accessible to voters with disabilities in each precinct; 
                 (          Must provide training for election officials and poll workers regarding disability issues; 
 
Federal money is used to improve physical accessibility of polling places. 
 
Physical access         
 
(          Requires that polling sites meet the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for     accessibility.  The U.S. Department of Justice has issued a publication, ADA Checklist for Polling Places, which one can view on their website at:  www.ada.gov/votingck.htm 
 
Accessible Voting systems 
 
(          Must have one accessible voting system in each voting precinct.  In Arizona, Sequoia equipment is used in Maricopa County, Automark in Cochise, Graham and Greenlee Counties, and Diebold is used in all other counties. 
 
Special Elections Boards A.R.S. '16-549 
 
      Generally, this state law provides for the ability to vote for persons who are ill or disabled, and are not able to vote in person and do not wish to vote by mail.  If one is confined as a result of illness or disability, the person may make a request to the County Recorder to have their ballot delivered to their location (i.e.: hospital, nursing home, etc.)  Such requests must be made by 5:00 p.m. on the second Friday before the election.  If one becomes disabled or ill after the second Friday before the election, the person can still request that a ballot be delivered and the County Recorder must make an effort to do so.  However, in this case, if the County Recorder is able to accommodate the request, the voted ballot shall be sealed in an envelope and is processed as a provisional ballot.   
 
Federal Agencies with Voting Rights  and Oversight Responsibilities 
 
(          U.S. Department of Justice (ADA, Section 504, HAVA) 
 
(          USDOJ has filed 11 HAVA related lawsuits against states, counties and cities, and have issued opinion letters and memoranda. 
 
(          U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HAVA - provides funds to states and P&A programs) (     Federal Election Commission 
 
 
(          The FEC was created by Congress in 1975 to administer and enforce the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA).  The FECA is the statute that governs the financing of federal elections. The FEC is an independent regulatory agency which discloses campaign finance information, enforces laws such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions, and oversees funding of Presidential elections.  
 
(          Election Assistance Commission (EAC) 
 
(          The EAC was created under HAVA as an independent commission which provides guidance on HAVA, adopts voluntary voting system guidelines, and provides guidance to election officials.  It also administers a national information clearinghouse regarding election administration and maintains the national mail voter registration form. 
 
(          National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
 
(          The NIST chairs the Technical Guidelines Development Committee, which was enacted by HAVA, to assist the EAC with development of voting systems guidelines. 
 
(          General Services Administration (HAVA - provides funds to state) 
 
Voting Rights Complaints 
 
One may file a voting rights complaint regarding the following issues: 
 
( 
 Polling place accessibility 
(HAVA - Secretary of State, ADA/Section 504 - U.S. Department of Justice); ( 
 Casting a private and independent ballot (HAVA - Secretary of State); ( 
 Voter registration issues 
(HAVA - Secretary of State, ADA/Section 504 - U.S. Department of Justice); ( 
 Lack of accommodations/modifications to allow equal access to voting 
(HAVA - Secretary of State, ADA/Section 504 - U.S. Department of Justice.)  Depending on whether election is local, state or federal, and the specifics of the complaint, there may be multiple avenues for complaints. Arizona Administrative Complaint Process 
 
      The Arizona Secretary of State=s Office accepts complaints with respect to violations of Title III of the Help America Vote Act only. One must submit the complaint form to the Secretary of State=s office, or can draft their own written complaint.  However, regardless of whether one uses the complaint form or drafts their own complaint, such a complaint must be in writing, notarized, signed and sworn to and must include information on the alleged violation and whether a hearing is requested.  (See Election Grievance Form in the appendix).  The complaint must be filed either in person or by mail.  The deadline for filing such a complaint is 60 days following the occurrence of the alleged violation. 
 
                (         Administrative Hearing Process 
 
      The Secretary of State will notify all respondents within 5 business days after receipt of the complaint.  If a hearing has been requested, the Secretary of State will notify the Office of 
Administrative Hearings (OAH) within 5 business days so that a hearing can be scheduled.  The hearing will be conducted within 10-60 days after receipt of the complaint by the Secretary of State.  In the hearing, the Complainant bears the burden of persuasion.  In other words, if you file a complaint alleging violation of HAVA, you will have to prove your position.  The hearing is conducted according to OAH rules.  (See appendix for a copy of OAH rules).  The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will hear your case, and will issue a recommended decision with an appropriate remedy, if the ALJ finds that a HAVA violation has occurred.  The ALJ decision is sent to the Secretary of State, who may accept, reject or modify the ALJ=s recommended decision, and will issue its final decision, which will be sent to the parties. 
 
      Final determination shall be made within 90 days of filing of the complaint with the Secretary of State=s office, unless Complainant consents to an extension. 
 
(          Alternative Dispute Resolution Process 
 
      If the Secretary of State fails to meet the 90 day deadline for the hearing process, the complaint shall be resolved within 60 days through Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).  Within 5 days after the 90 day deadline, the Secretary of State shall designate an ALJ who will sit as a neutral party, and will review the record.  The ALJ may request additional documents, briefs, memoranda and/or testimony from the parties.  The ALJ will then make a decision and decide an appropriate remedy if a HAVA violation is found.  The ALJ will issue a written decision within 60 days of the initial 90 day deadline.  A new 60 day deadline can be extended with the consent of the Complainant. 
 
(          Remedies Available 
 
The ALJ can recommend, and/or the Secretary of State can order: 
 
(          A plan to rectify the violation (for instance, if the complaint involved physical accessibility, it may be ordered that the entity undertake accessibility modification to the polling site, or use an alternative, accessible site); 
 
                 (         An order requiring additional training of election officials; 
 
                 (         An order requiring additional voter education. 
 
      There are no compensatory or punitive damages available for HAVA complaints, nor a finding that an election official is subject to civil penalties. 
 
(          Complaint Record              
 
      The Secretary of State will compile and maintain an official record of each complaint, which will be retained for 24 months.
